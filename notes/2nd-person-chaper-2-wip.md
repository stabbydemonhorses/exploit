# Chapter 2
_I’m safe_, you tell yourself. _Safe enough._ You’re an idiot if you believe it. 

They’ll know you’re on Dressara. It’s a big moon, you say. They’ll find you eventually. But it’ll take them awhile. They’ll have tracked your ship. But it’s safely in an orbital bunker. Ships like yours aren’t allowed to land, anyway. At least they’ll repair it for you. You’re not sure what you’ll do with the other ship.

It takes five minutes to walk to the rear of the police outpost.  People like you can’t use the main entrance. It isn’t that you’re planning on hurting anyone in particular; rather, without an Alt, you don’t have anything to vouch for you.

Instead, you have to turn in your weapons. They let you keep your helmet. Privacy is sacrosanct; hunters’ privacy more so, particularly to the police. 

They try to shove a dozen-odd new cases at you. Perhaps no hunters have been by in awhile. 

“My hands are already more than full,” you lie. In truth, you have no warrants beyond the two you stole from the hunters after you.

The police don’t care what you may have done, so long as _they_ don’t have to do the deadly work of apprehending suspects.

The recruiting banner on the wall says as much: “Get a new start. Become a hunter.” They’ll even help you jump the line for a new face.

All but two terminals are broken. Both are in use, and both by other hunters. You look over their shoulders, but neither is looking for you. They’re not even looking for the Dressaran woman.

You glance at the warrant card. You still can’t tell if she’s happy or if she wants to eat you for dinner. Probably both, knowing Dressarans. ‘Elise,’ it says, but if she’s not already been found, she’s probably been to Faces for a new identity.

Finally, one of them leaves.

It’s easy to find records on this ‘Elise.’ You grimace at the detail. You really oughtn’t know some of this. You’re surprised the police records include it. Usually more care is taken.

But there’s nothing recent. Nothing before three years ago.

Your breath stops for a moment. Really, Leanne? 

Then again, it’s not your most idiotic notion. While ‘three years’ isn’t much of a connection to yourself—a lot happened three years ago—you do already know there’s a connection between the two of you. You’re both on the same warrant.

You wonder if you knew her, once. Maybe she’ll know you. Maybe she’ll know who you were.

Maybe she remembers more than three years back.

----

The women of Dressara often wore dresses, which you both admire and find a shame. You enjoy wearing dresses, so long as they cover your shoulders, but you find women in suits much more handsome.

Delphine is nothing if not handsome. She’s tall, and does her best to look so: her fine Elisian suit lengthens her body, and she’s paired it, rather with than pants, with a skirt just long enough to wave gently in the light breeze the Dressarans were so fond of.

Dressara is the larger of Seven’s two moons. It’s pleasant enough if you like their sort of pomp, which you don’t, but it’s better than Seven itself, which is quite dour.

It’s inhabited only by a few thousand people, plus each of their few thousand servants. There was a party nearly daily, and everyone was invited. Sometimes the servants, too.

The men do little more than stand about all day, whether at parties or at home. The women, you assume, do something more than simply wear their dresses and stroll about—even the wealthy have to bring in money somehow—but whatever they do, it isn’t interesting enough for you to know about it.

But if any Dressaran woman—or, for that matter, any Dressaran at all—were ever to do anything remotely interesting, you’d bet it would be Delphine.

Delphine is the target. It’s obvious. She looks different now, of course. On the card, her name had been ‘Elise.’ Her face had been soft, now it was angular; her hair long and red, now short and black. But there was no mistaking her.

She’d probably only changed face once. Faces records could only be unsealed with a half-dozen odd warrants signed on nearly as many planetary bodies, but the records are hardly necessary. They rarely are. It’s generally easy enough to guess what people will do with their new identities, even if your peers don’t seem to have enough imagination to do so. You aren’t special; they’re just stupid.

A Dressaran woman like Delphine wouldn’t miss out on the lavish parties her relations so often threw, even if she would now need to attend as a guest in order not to be associated with whatever scandals lied in her past.

You’re not going to learn anything from her, Leanne. She’s Dressaran, after all. She’ll know nothing of use.

Go ahead tell yourself that you’ll learn something useful. You just want to fuck her. 

It’s easy to see. You shiver every time you look at her, and it’s not cold out, even if you aren’t accustomed to showing so much skin. The dress you stole covers everything important. Even your knives. Yes, your shoulders are bare, but get over it. Girls like scars, anyway.

You look away. Delphine is approaching. She probably noticed you looking at her. You’re supposed to be a servant.

Your neck tightens. Back straightens. Eyes glance down.

A hand taps your shoulder. You jump.

“My apologies,” said Delphine, her voice deep and melodic. “I didn’t mean to startle you.”

You tear you eyes away from her lips—half smile, half smirk, and that same blue lipstick—and up to her eyes, kind and  stalwart, framed by her short black hair.

“A red,” Delphine instructs you. “Syrah. From Earth. Not that Lyonan nonsense.”

You nod readily. Your heart beats unevenly. You feel yourself move towards the far end of the garden, over to where the bar is.

Should have invited yourself. The security is laughable. Dressarans tend to assume they’re safe at all times. Well, rather, they assume they could be killed at any time, which amounts to the same. If they don’t recognize you, they’d assume their Alt is forgetful. They’d make smalltalk just fine, and be friendly enough.

But while Dressarans rarely have much of substance to say, when they do, they generally only share it with those they know well. Even those that would recognize you from your previous intrusions would not feel so comfortable around you. Servants, however, are generally invisible, and next in line to be the masters anyway, and so are generally considered part of the family.

Still, if all you’re interested in is scoring, you’d have done better inviting yourself proper.

You shiver as you pour the wine. The artificial wind tickles the scars upon your shoulders, the scar Delphine had tapped, the scar you received on the moon Delphinia after thirty assassins cornered you.

Delphine named herself after the moon, you assume. As much as Dressarans look down upon the other planets and moons, they have a habit of naming their children after them: “Delphine,” “Lyon,” “Tria,” “Elsa.”

“Ma’am,” you say, eyes downcast. You hand Delphine her glass. You’re on the outskirts of the party, off a paved path near one of the rear doors of the house. You forget whose house.

She’s not interested in you. Her eyes are locked on a woman wrapped in rich violet. Center of attention. The hostess. Then again, Delphine may not be interested in her, either. She could be family.

No. There’s something else. Delphine may be hard to read, but there must be something between the two, lost in a past Delphine knows she can never truly rejoin…

“They could’ve done it already, for all we know,” the other woman’s voice drifts over. “We’d have no idea for, what, ten years?”

Ah. Earth, and what horrible things they’ve almost certainly been up to: the Dressarans’ favorite topic.

You catch Delphine hide a small, amused smile.

She takes the glass from you. Her fingers wind about it delicately, her bright white fingernails clicking gently against it.

She tears her gaze away from the hostess. Glances you up and down. The corner of her lips turns up a bit further.

“You look stunning, obviously,” you hear yourself say.

A soft chuckle escapes Delphine as you keep your eyes from widening. “Obviously,” she agrees. “Not that you’ve done poorly for yourself.”

“I’m no different from the others,” you make yourself say, nodding your head to the other servants, busy attending a loud crowd of primping Dressaran men.

Delphine glances at them. They’re making their way towards the violent-wrapped woman, conspiracies of warp drives and illegal experiments upon their lips—

And Delphine drags her gaze back to you.

“I don’t think so,” she says. Her smirk fades a bit as she glances at the wine in her hand. Her eyes try to dart over— “Not that there’s anything wrong with them. They’re just…”

Her eyes harden and turn back to your own. “Not you.”

You should go; she knows, she knows you’re not who you say, she knows you’re not goo— “Not me, no.”

“Then who are you?” she asks you. There’s not enough space between you, anymore; she’s stepped forward; why are you still standing there? You shoul—

“Why come as a servan?” she asks. “They wouldn’t know the difference if you came as Queen of Dressara.”

A small laugh escapes before you can stifle it. Why you find it funny is anyone’s guess; it’s a bit of a stretch even for a joke. Dressara never had a queen. Neither had any planet or moon in Q729, although that could change if the secessionists’ futile dreams ever come true.

“You knew the difference,” you tell her.

“I’m not from Dressara,” says Delphine.

“Yes, you are,” you reply.

Delphine’s smirk returns in full. “So, you’re here for me.”

Well done, Leanne. Why not tell her your deepest secrets while you’re at it? But you’re not thinking. Something about Delphine makes your chest tighten. Your breath is actually quivering.

“So to speak,” you say. Sigh. Not a bad response. Perhaps you do have a plan, after all. It’s impossible to tell. You look to the side. Try to count what you see: two stones in the grass; a tree; three branches; yellow lights of the party, glittering in Delphine’s brown eyes—

“Well, introduce yourself,” says Delphine.

You take a breath. Straighten your back. Look up into those sparkling eyes.

“Leanne,” you say.

What else can you say? You don’t know where you’re from. You can hardly say what you do. ‘Assassin?’ ‘Pilot?’ ‘Hunter’ perhaps; it would at least be legal, and sometimes even the truth.

“And you know me,” says Delphine, bringing the wine up between you. She takes a long, deliberate sip.

“I know you’re from Dressara,” you say. It had been on the card, and in the police database. Delphine is Dressaran. Oughtn’t be anything interesting about her.

“My _parents_ were from Dressara,” says Delphine. She glances down at her drink, her bow furrowing slightly. Then, back to you.

You raise an eyebrow. Take a small step forward. Tentatively push Delphine agains the mahogany door behind her. It must’ve been imported from Earth; the door alone must be worth—

“And you?” you ask.

“Somewhere else,” answers Delphine, leaning easily away from you, her head tilted slightly back, her voice almost lost in the noise of the party, a small smile tugging not quite reluctantly at her lips.

“Not what I’ve read,” you say. You place your palms against the door either side of Delphine. The left one is still bothering you. You try to ignore it. You lean over her. You still have to look up into her eyes. You pull the card from beneath your dress, not breaking your gaze.

The corner of Delphine’s lips tug upwards again. You think a brief glimpse of surprise crosses her face sash glances at the card, but it’s hard to be certain: your lungs had tightened again, and—

Delphine brings the wine up between you again, snaking her arm around yours.

“Hardly looks like me,” she says. “Perhaps you have me mistaken.”

“There’s no mistaking you, I’m sure,” you say. “Even if you have changed name and face.”

Delphine smiles; there’s a hint of sad wistfulness. Her eyes once again glance at the hostess. You feel yourself begin to frown.

“Well then,” says Delphine, “what else do you think you know about me?”

She pulls herself away from the wall. Stands to her full height. You meet her gaze—she’s easily a foot taller than you. You force yourself not to flinch away.

“More than I ought,” you admit. “I… admit I know what your parents named you. I’m sorry.”

You wouldn’t want others to know what your parents named you, even if you knew.

Delphine shrugs her shoulders. She glances away again—smugly, perhaps. Her suit lifted up. Her shirt was untucked, the skin beneath it was—

“So do I,” she says. “Hardly makes you special.”

“And what if I’m here to kill you?” you ask, reaching a hand down to the hem of your dress, where, for all Delphine knew, you could have a knife. You in fact have five. You still haven’t replaced the sixth, but generally you need only one.

“Strangers always are,” Delphine responds, meeting your stare once more. “Still not special.”

“And what if I wasn’t?” you ask. “What if…”

Your heart bangs against your chest. Fuck, interrogate, or kill? Perhaps all three, perhaps in that order, and perhaps it didn’t matter, and perhaps you’re stupid enough not to care.

You collect all the pride you can find as the party’s music swells. Hold out a hand. Look again into Delphine’s eyes.

“What if all I want, for the moment, is a dance?” you ask, forcing the words out smoothly, struggling not to look away.

Again, Delphine’s eyes dart away, just for a second. She shakes herself slightly; her face steadies.

“Me, dance with a servant?” she asks. “A Dressaran would never lower herself.”

“You’re not Dressaran,” you say.

Her smile twitches. You find yourself smiling in return, and feel boldness rush into your chest.

“If all I, a stranger, want for the evening… is to dance with a woman as obviously stunning as yourself… Would I be special then?”

Delphine’s smirk unfolds into a small, sweet smile, and her hand takes yours.

“Perhaps.”

----

She shoves you against the wall. The door thumps closed somewhere in the distance.

Shivers shake down your sides as her hands brush down them, the silvery fabric rippling beneath them. They reach your thighs; feel the hilt of one of your knives—

Delphine smiles. Pleased? Excited? You follow Delphine’s eyes down, then back. Your breath quickens. She waits for an answer.

You nod. “The third one,” you tell her, barely whispering. This isn’t safe, Leanne; you should— 

Delphine smiles wickedly, and pulls on the third knife through the fabric. It snaps easily from your custom-printed holster.

You feel its edge trace against your thigh. You swallow. A shiver reverberates through you; your hands twitch, ready for— 

But Delphine looks down at you again. Questioning. Even unsure.

“Want?” Delphine asks, aloud this time.

You nod again, but it’s not enough for her.

“Want?” she repeats.

You smile back. A different sort of shiver now travels through you. You steady your hands. Place the right, then the left, gently upon Delphine’s thighs. She sinks into them, a quiet breath escaping her.

“Want,” you say, firmly.

A brief, giddy smile flashes across her face. She turns her head away to compose herself, biting her lip a bit, and you feel yourself inching forwards…

“Wait,” she says, “I have to-“

She hands the knife back to you and draws herself away, breathing in little laughs. Rips off her skirt. 

Your lips go dry. Don’t stare, Leanne.

She tears at the buttons of her shirt. Your heart beats funny, but you maintain composure—

A small gold chain dangles around her neck. Between her breasts, hanging upon the chain, rests a small, sheathed, wickedly curved knife.

You glance at it. She shakes her head.

“Maybe later,” she says, after a moment. She unhooks the knife from the chain. A small golden key remains. She disentangles herself from you. Walks to a dresser.

You hadn’t noticed the dresser. You hadn’t noticed any of the room, really. It’s smaller than you’d expect: just enough room for the bed, its lonely nightstand, and the tall dresser with its locked cabinet.

All incredibly old. Polished dark wood contrasts against smooth bright wood floor. More ornate than the simple clean design Dressarans generally preferred in their Earthen antiques— but then, Delphine wasn’t Dressaran.

Delphine unlocked the cabinet with her key, turning the lock from vertical to horizontal. She places the knife gingerly upon a stand amongst various other Earthen antiques, many of them weapons, including a long curved sword and no less than two ancient guns—revolvers, you assume.

The knife must be special. Or poisoned. Perhaps both.

Locking the door once more—horizontal to vertical—she turns back to you.

Stop staring. Look up. Yes, the key does shine nicely against her skin, but she’s looking at you. She’s waiting.

Finally, your eyes reach hers. She pointedly glances at where your own knives are strapped. Her eyebrow raises expectantly. You take the hint lay your knives on the nightstand. 

She holds out her hand.

You’re still holding the knife. It’s your favorite one, and if it wasn’t, it is now. You hold it out. A cheeky smile blooms upon your face.

Delphine begins to reach for it. She nearly breaks out in a grin; your heart leaps.

“You’ll tell me if it’s too much?” she asks.

“I will.”

“Good.”

“And you?” you ask.

“Of course,” she says. She hesitates. “I, uh, my plumbing is original; I prefer mine like, I mean, I don’t know if you’re okay…”

“Of course,” you say. You’d noticed when she took of her skirt. You pause. “I don’t think mine is, though,” you tell her.  “Original, I mean.”

It’s hard to tell, but you’ve always felt… well, it’s hard to describe. You can tell she wants to ask how you can be uncertain about such things, but it’s a story for another time, and she knows it.

She holds out her hand. A shiver flows through you again as you place the knife in her hand.

Her fingers close around its hilt. She lifts it. Feels its weight. Thumbs its edge.

Not so sharp. Not too dull. Perfect for this.

She takes a step forward, and you feel yourself fall onto the bed. Its softness folds around you.

You feel her climb atop you. The knife’s blade touches your skin— 

The world swims, gently, away.
