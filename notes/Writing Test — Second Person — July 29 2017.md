# Second Person Writing Test

## Test
You awake, again to violence, scalpel in hand, surrounded by bodies, coated in blood, the woman in the suit turning slowly away—

You awake, again to violence, this time real, griprail in hand, hand straining, your body not touching your bed, your ship spinning around you. Heavy energy cells bruise you; one barely misses your eye! You ought to have strapped down their container, and you oughtn’t have kept them in the bedroom to begin with. You knew this. Why do you refuse to listen?

Switch arms, Leanne! Now! Again, you don’t listen, and again you suffer for it. Well, could be worse. It’s not broken, and besides, you have another.

Instead of switching arms, you simply let go. Stupid. You avoid breaking your neck as you slam into one wall of metal grating then another. The rough edges dig into your arms, slicing up your skin; then your legs—you feel one of your knives break, and the blade of another digs into your skin.

Then your face hits a wall. Your nose— well, what’s a bit of blood? But your vision blurs. If you’d just listen! 

Three, two, one— Kick! Thank you! Perfect timing; you fly right over to the cockpit door; your hand ensnares the adjacent griprail. Wrong arm! The pain screams at you, but thankfully, you don’t listen to it, either: your grip remains unbroken.


## Notes
- Needs sentence-by-sentence refinement
- Tricky to balance tone of narrator. Should be:
  - exasparated
  - ultimately well-meaning
  - full of ideas
- What I'm going for (spoilers):
  - Narrator is Leanne's Alt (brain implant)
  - Communication channel between the Alt & Leanne is not good (but does exist). Leanne, as a result, thinks she has no Alt at all.
  - For most people, they & their Alt are one entity, no real boundary between them. For Leanne & her Alt, they are different entities,
    _because_ the communication between them doesn't work well (if that were fixed, they'd become one, like they ought to be, probably;
    though some things can never be fully repaired, perhaps).
  - Most peoples' Alts don't help them hurt people. Period. Doesn't matter if you're criminal or police. Leanne's does.
  - But, symbolically, Leanne's Alt is meant to be anxiety. Trying to write its narration from the perspective of my own anxiety.
- Why balancing is hard (still spoilers):
  - The Alt is very frustrated with Leanne, as she never hears it.
  - The Alt represents anxiety, and so is crictical of and fearful for Leanne (to mirror my own experience with anxiety)
  - If I go too far in this direction, two things could happen:
    - Narration will seem way too overly critical, and make the story unpleasant/hard to read.
    - Reader will realize the narrator is Leanne's Alt, which really should only be implied or suggested.
