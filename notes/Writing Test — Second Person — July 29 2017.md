# Second Person Writing Test

## Test

You awake, again to violence, scalpel in hand, surrounded by bodies, coated in blood, the woman in the suit turning slowly away—

You awake, again to violence, this time real, griprail in hand, hand straining, body not touching bed, ship spinning about you, heavy energy cells brushing you. One cell barely misses your eye! You ought’ve strapped their container down proper. Hell, you should’ve put them in the cargo hold. You knew this but you never listen, not even to yourself.

Grab one— or don’t. To be fair, you can’t think about much more than the pain in your arm. You need to switch arms, Leanne. Switch! Now!

Again, you don’t listen, and again you suffer for it. Well, could be worse. It’s not broken, and besides, you have another.

Instead of switching arms, you simply let go. Stupid. You avoid breaking your neck as you slam into one wall of metal grating then another. The rough edges dig into your arms, slicing up your skin; then your legs—you feel one of your knives break, and the blade of another digs into your skin.

Then your face hits a wall. Your nose— well, what’s a bit of blood? But your vision blurs. If you had just—  

Focus. Three, two, one— Kick! Thank you! Perfect timing: you fly right over to the cockpit door; your hand ensnares the adjacent griprail. 

Wrong arm! The pain screams at you, but thankfully, you don’t listen to it, either: your grip remains unbroken.

You swing up your good arm. Pull!

The gravgen is beneath the console. Careful!

It does not start. Figures. Needs an energy cell. Should’ve grabbed one. Luckily, they’re not hard to find. Well, that’s a lie. But you have a stolen crateful of them ricocheting around your bedroom, and a dozen bruises to show for it. Today, even you ought to be able to find one.

You sling the gravgen over your shoulder. It bangs into the wall a little hard, but should be fine. It was made for military use—doesn’t even need an Alt to operate, which is just as well: even if you had a working Alt, it wouldn’t help you: Alts never helped people hurt each other.

The ship’s spin keeps you solidly against the right cockpit wall. You guess it’ll serve as gravity well enough, even if it feels two times too strong. 

You pull yourself out of the cockpit. Duck! The power cell missed your face by an inch. Choose: desk, bed, or cockpit? You pick the most dangerous. Straddle the cockpit entry. Trust the spin to keep you steady. Let go of the rails, use your arm.

Above you: it’ll come into reach in three, two—

The power cell slams into your hand. Your fingers close around it. The pain isn’t _that_ bad, Leanne, but grunt away if that helps you. You got what you need.

Slam that cell in, strap the gravgen on, aim, power—

You fall to the wall. Aim again, kick the switch, and you fall to the ceiling. You need to practice more. It’ll do.

A dozen power cells are still darting around. No! Leanne, don’t grab them, not now—

You stop.

You can hear them. They’re actually boarding. Bold. Either they’re hunters with a warrant to bring you in alive, or they’re assassins commanded to make it personal. They’re either stupidly idiotic or stupidly skilled. 

It’s probably skill. They must have rammed you, which means they have a ship. Military model, just like yours; anything less would need an Alt to pilot.

They’ll enter unprotected, which is good for you: they won’t tolerate the vacuum any better than you.

Your hand reaches to your thigh just as your bedroom door opens. 

Wait!

You don’t wait. You throw the knife. Idiot. The gravgen only affects the area immediately around you. It wildly misses its target.

At least it distracted your attacker. His eyes follow it as it bounces off the wall behind your bed.

You grab another knife. Flatten yourself against the wall. Twist the gravgen. Aim it at the attacker. Up the power, and kick the switch again—

Air leaves your lungs as you slam into the wall, and again as your attacker slams into you, right onto your knife.


## Notes
- Needs sentence-by-sentence refinement
- Tricky to balance tone of narrator. Should be:
  - exasparated
  - ultimately well-meaning
  - full of ideas
- What I'm going for (spoilers):
  - Narrator is Leanne's Alt (brain implant)
  - Communication channel between the Alt & Leanne is not good (but does exist). Leanne, as a result, thinks she has no Alt at all.
  - For most people, they & their Alt are one entity, no real boundary between them. For Leanne & her Alt, they are different entities,
    _because_ the communication between them doesn't work well (if that were fixed, they'd become one, like they ought to be, probably;
    though some things can never be fully repaired, perhaps).
  - Most peoples' Alts don't help them hurt people. Period. Doesn't matter if you're criminal or police. Leanne's does.
  - But, symbolically, Leanne's Alt is meant to be anxiety. Trying to write its narration from the perspective of my own anxiety.
- Why balancing is hard (still spoilers):
  - The Alt is very frustrated with Leanne, as she never hears it.
  - The Alt represents anxiety, and so is crictical of and fearful for Leanne (to mirror my own experience with anxiety)
  - If I go too far in this direction, two things could happen:
    - Narration will seem way too overly critical, and make the story unpleasant/hard to read.
    - Reader will realize the narrator is Leanne's Alt, which really should only be implied or suggested.
