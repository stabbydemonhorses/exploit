# Beat Sheet written July 2017

## Notes:

### Anxiety (I think)
I frequently struggle with this paralyzing feeling; a fear, not always backed up by reason, frequently even lacking any cause upon which to blame it. I _think_ this feeling is referred to as anxiety. If not: my apologies. I'm not going to be referring to it by name in the story anyway (only the feelings).

I do my best to work past it, anyway.

Leanne already had some issues with this, but I had:
  - not quite realized I had been giving them to her
  - not quite realized the extent to which I deal with it


I hope that now I can bring out this aspect of her a bit more.

Motifs:

- Things never working
- Reluctance to take action/be an active protagonist
- Leanne having let slide little things
- Sometimes (but not always): taking action anyway

Possible metaphors to keep semi-consistent:

NOTE: metaphors are best when subtle. That is: if I decide I like treating X as a metaphor for Y, I don't want to shove it in people's faces. Instead, I just want to keep my writing as it applies to X consistent with Y.

- Leanne's Alt: 
  - Leanne has an Alt, but she believes she doesn't. 
  - Her Alt is vital to her survival in that it helps her fight. 
  - Potential metaphor (possible reason I decided on this for Leanne in the first place): 
    - sometimes, you can't rescue yourself
    - sometimes, you need to realize you need help... 
    - sometimes, you need to realize you _have_ help.
    - sometimes, you feel alone. sometimes, you really aren't. <-- I like this one
  - Leanne has people looking out for her. Some are good. Some aren't (even though they want to protect her)

## Beats
- Awake to violence
- Awake to violence x2
  - hard to tell what is really reality (sort of calls back to "From My Box, With Chocolate"
- Q: what is she wearing? Nothing?
  - It would be a scifi trope for her to be wearing nothing.
    - That may be good, as I want many genre things in here
    - may be bad, as I also want to be clever about how I do my tropes
  - What if she's wearing _almost_ nothing. Belt of knives around her thigh.
- Tossed around w/power cells
  - Feels hopeless
  - She's a badass who feels like anything but
- Grabs griprail, hauls self into cockpit
- Grav gen won't start. Out of power. Didn't put new cell in.
  - Not putting in new cell: she's lazy... but that laziness likely is because everything--even putting in new power cells--seems difficult.
- Hit in head by power cell while exiting cockpit. They're heavy.
  - Opportunity to describe them a bit
  - Her head will be spinning a bit through rest of scene
- Grabs metal desk leg with her legs
- Grabs cell that hit her
- Tries to remove cell from grav gen
  - Didn't think it through: hands full. Tries to hold new cell under shoulder. Somewaht silly: cells are flying everywhere.
- Hears people entering her ship.
- Turns to go
- Turns back to grab remaining cells and stuff them away, strap them down.
  - This can be viewed two ways, but either way seems like something she'd do:
    - She's learning from her previous mistake
    - She's doing thing she worries about at inopportune time because she's too worried about it
  - I also considered she could leave them out and use them against her enemies.
    - Perhaps: toss in a mention that she could've, but "too late, now."
- Enemies break into the bedroom. They do not have grav gen. Struggling to bring themselves into room by griprails.
- If she could get her grav gen working...
- Observes:
  - They have ship: that's rare for anyone, much less assassins.
  - More likely: they are bounty hunters.
- Grav gen starts.
- Reaches to thigh; throws knife
- Diverts oddly, bounces along walls
- Idiot: gravity only affected near her
- Fine. Twists manipulator. Grabs another knife. Pulls enemy onto it.
- Uses gravity on wall near another. He saw her. He was going to twist away. Left, she thought: she slit his throat. If she had more time, she'd be impressed with herself.
- Blood added to existing stains
- She moves to side in time for a bullet to pass her by
- Kicks off a wall in opposite direction of ship's spin.
- Grabs man while flying.
- Spins him around. Lands on him. Face crunhes in.
- His hand released his gun. She caught it.
- Shoots two more people in the room just as they train sights.
- Shoots two more entering, but:
  - revolver
  - out-of-ammo
  - she hadn't noticed
  - (basically: things not working, and she's angry about it, but really: her fault)
- doesn't quite dodge kick to head
- head spinning worse
- kicker didn't even mean to hit her; had lost their grip
- Feels dizzy
- Misaims grav gun
- Slams against wall; Pressure immense. Man lands on top of her.
- She sees knife; her own, the one she had lost
- catches it
- other hand grabs grav manip, points it at wall
- flings man across room, her with him
- twists hand
- flash of silver
- darkness

----

- Wakes to what remains
- Vision unclear. Lights foggy.
- Bodies everywhere. More than she remembered.
- On floor. Grav manip keeping her steady.
- Ship still spinning
- Guns flying through air, banging. Most very damaged.
- Had it been five minutes?
- Pelted by the guns. Bruised everywhere
- Nothing broken
- Good everything else is strapped down. Probably.
- Breathe
- She needs to stop the ship's spinning!
- Goes to cockpit. Walks normally. Grav manip is working, thank goodness.
- Ship won't start. Of course. Typically takes a machine to repair ships. Particularly without an Alt to guide you.
  - Still: probably a standard cable. They were rather rigid, had tendency to break at joings under strain.
  - Could find & replace if things would just stop spinning.
- Goes to other ship. Goes to cockpit.
  - Question: is it important how this other ship looks?
    - It belongs to bounty hunters.
- Manipulates controls. Steadies ships.
  - They had rammed her.
  - Thought they would be more capable of working with it than her.
- Finds photo of self
- Bounty.
  - An unusual one: not a simple live or dead. Orders were to engage. Never seen that on a bounty. Only assassinations (which weren't legal)
  - Explains manpower
  - Said where she frequented. Stupid. She should've mixed up her routine more.
  - Had her appearance.
  - She looked for more information. Anything from before...? No.
- But there's another photo. Another job.
  - Sloppy.
- No indication of who ordered. 
  - System for bounties almost identical, cryptographically speaking, to system for assassinations.
  - Don't know which came first.
  - Most assassins take bounties, and vice-versa.
  - Leanne favored bounties. Needed them to get around.
    - Question: how deep to go into what Alts are here?
  - Lacking an Alt to vouch for her, Leanne's options were limited
- Photo: Elise. Dressaran. Slight smirk. There was various other media attached. Videos.
- She was likely dead. She had been on Four when its Exploit had gone awry.
- Why were they ordered at the same time?
- Knowing herself, it was academic. She was unlikely to investigate further.
- But Elise had last been seen three years ago.
- Could that possibly be a coincidence?
- Sees gun on wall. Nice enough, she supposed.
  - Might be nice to have detail on what's nice about it
- Rips cabling out of other ship. 
  - She should just steal their ship. It's faster, better, heavier.
  - But...


----

- Intro to Dressara
- Leanne at party
- Why put out a job for this 'Elise', unless she was, in fact, still around?
- Her facial features had likely changed by now. Would have visited Faces.
- Possible warrant would have included, but often the reason a bounty hunter is hired is because warrant for bounties is far easier to obtain than warrant for Faces info.
  - Later, Leanne will have to rforge a warrant for info on herself.
- Mannerisms, though, would be the same: Partygoer, and, knowing Dressarans, wouldn't care if it made her a target.
- Yet, Leanne had seen she would always socialize and then withdraw to a corner to observe.
  - Likely stirring up trouble and then observing the results.
- And she made a point of visiting the Lansome parties, even when she was on Four.
- Would be stupid of her to still be attending.
- Then again, she was Dressaran. And there was a Dressaran woman walking away from the party, a slight smirk on her face.

TODO:

- It will turn out that Delphine (formerly Elise) has been taking out assassination orders agaisnt her continuously, in order to interrogate assassins.
- But, she did not make the bounty order.
- Oh, and Leanne & Delphine fuck.
