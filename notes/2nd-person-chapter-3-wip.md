# Chapter 3
Seven rose just as it had set: early. Its dim light shines through the open shutters. Even with Dressara’s longer cycle, you’re sure you did not sleep enough. Some of that was undoubtedly your own fault, and some of it was certainly Delphine’s, in whose arms and sheets you’re still tangled.

She’s snoring just audibly. You can’t suppress a little smile. The night had been long; the morning longer.

What woke you? Hard to tell. You don’t usually wake until fully rested, but you also don’t usually share a bed.

Check the window. Scan the sky. Clear dawn, smoothly gray with hints of purple and green.

Walls? Nothing. Door? Closed.

The air is crisp and fresh, as Dressaran air always is. A tiny smell of berries. Likely the kitchen preparing breakfast. You glance at Delphine—still snoring, head snuggled into pillow, the sheets a bright white halo around her; you smile again. Perhaps you’d have breakfast in bed—

A snap from outside— but it was only a squirrel. It peeks through the windows. Tilts its head, a nut between its paws. Skitters off.

Your good hand twitches.

The floor’s covered haphazardly in clothing. Knives still on the nightstand, your favorite set aside for cleaning. You brush a finger across your chest, where you can still feel its marks; a little, giggly smile forces its way onto your face…

You pull yourself up, leaving a calming hand on Delphine’s arm. Glance at the cabinet.

You had admired how its key had shone against Delphine’s—

You swallow.

Your eyes dart around the room.

No gold.

Not resting where it belongs on Delphine’s chest. Not sitting atop the nightstand. Not dropped within the sheets, not laying upon the floor—

The key is gone.

The cabinet(; closed. The lock…

Horizontal. Unlocked.

The room was still.

Delphine’s not snoring anymore.

A flash—

Delphine leaps from the bed. Brings the sheets up; twists; a knife flies across the room, past the man hovering at the foot of the bed—

You recognize him. “Elsar,” he calls himself. A silly name, you think. Proud member of the “golden” generation of assassins: rather large, but not all that tall; physically strong, mentally competent, often irritable.

He had a reputation for making his kills appear as accidents. Delphine’s knife would’ve accomplished that perfectly, particularly given the activities in which she and you were engaged the previous evening.

Elsar must have watched you. Your fury flares.

His hand shoots out and grabs Delphine’s neck. She grasps his wrist and twists. He yanks it away with a scream. Typical. He has a habit of underestimating his opponents. Only ever takes the easy kills, and decides that therefore all kills must be easy. 

But then why is he here for you and Delphine?

You stand, steady even as the soft bed sinks beneath your feet.

Elsar looks from Delphine to you. He seems surprised to see your face. Strange: even if he didn’t see your face properly last night, the warrant was for you both.

He leaps across the bed, straight at you. You drop against the downy comforter, letting him fly over—

He twists inflight. You twist your head out of the way of his foot. He lands in a roll, grabbing your favorite knife off the nightstand. Your mouth twitches angrily.

You rip the sheets from the bed. Delphine has the same idea. You both dive at Elsar, the sheet stretched between you. He lashes out with the knife. It tears at the sheet, but as one of the safer knives from your collection, it doesn’t slice through nearly so much as he’d hope.

You feel Delphine’s side of the sheet drop. Don’t lose focus.

You flick the sheet up around Elsar. He tries to duck under, but his face gets wrapped within it.

You leap backwards. Pull the sheet. Hard. His head yanks towards the bed. 

Twist away! He’s going to— but you’re not quick enough. His fist meets your left arm.

Don’t grunt. It still isn’t broken. Still safe to use.

You snap it back. Grasp his hair. Reach your right arm around him—

Delphine rams you.

You and Elsar fall to the floor. Delphine pushes you aside.

He tries to get to his feet, but Delphine kicks him in the small of his back.

He falls to his knees.

She grabs his hair, much as you had. To his throat she holds her knife.

You stand. Delphine doesn’t attack you this time.

“Disarm him,” she commands. 

You obey. Three knives. Two guns. Poison.

“The card?” she asks.

“They won’t say who hired him,” you tell her.

“I know who hired him,” Delphine grinds out, her eyes not moving from the back of his head. He didn’t move a muscle. First smart choice he’s made, you think.

You search him again. Find the card. Only one. Delphine’s on it. Delphine herself. Not ‘Elise.’

Don’t show your confusion, Leanne.

You hold it up for Delphine to see. She nods, satisfied.

“Where were you when the Exploit on Four went awry?” she asks Elsar.

He says nothing. Her knife digs in. A drop of blood pools beneath it.

“Where were you?” she asks, again.

“A job on two,” he says. It’s a lie. He wasn’t even a hunter yet.

Delphine can tell.

“Try again.”

“I—“

“I will know if you lie, so consider your words carefully,” she says.

He does.

“I was not yet a Hunter,” he says. He nods his head at you. “She can confirm.”

Delphine looks at you. You see her face drop.

Elsar begins to move. Delphine digs the knife in deeper. He stills.

“What do you know of the incident?” she asks. “Who may have been there? Any hunter? Assassin?”

“Nothing. Nobody will know anything. Nobody was there,” he says. “None of us. No hunter, no assassin, nobody.”

You’re not sure how he would know. Perhaps he doesn’t. Perhaps he’s guessing. Or perhaps he’s heard rumors.

“Nobody?” Delphine asks.

“Can’t speak for her,” he says, his eyes flicking towards you again, “but I don’t think she was a hunter yet, then, either.”

Delphine glances at you again. You shrug. She raises an eyebrow. 

You don’t want to say more in front of Elsar.

So, Delphine slits his throat.

Close your mouth, Leanne. You’d have done the same. He’s a hunter. You couldn’t exactly let him go.

She allows his body to drop to the floor. Turns to you.

“Where were _you_ three years ago?”

You stand up straight. Look her dead in the eyes. If she lunges at you, dodge right, sweep your legs. If she reaches for you, grab her arms and pull. If she walks around you, turn to follow. If she—

“I don’t know,” you tell her.

That was not the response she was expecting. She says nothing. She expects you to elucidate.

“My memory only goes three years back,” you say.

“To the incident?”

“Four months after.”

“Convenient,” she says, her eyes slightly narrowed.

“Not really.”

She takes a step forward. Your right hand opens. She notices. She doesn’t advance further.

“I woke up on Delphinia,” you tell her. “Killed a bunch of people. Got scars. That’s when my life began.”

She doesn’t look quite satisfied. But you don’t have anything more to tell her, and she knows it.

“Who hired him?” you ask, nodding at Elsar.

“Me,” she says.

%% Next: something happens to make them run. Perhaps the people after Leanne show up. Delphine kills another person by kicking & slicing, but no interrogation.
