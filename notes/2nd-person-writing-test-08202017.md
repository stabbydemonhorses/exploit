You awake, again to violence, scalpel in hand, bodies surrounding you, coated in blood, the woman in the suit slowly turning away—

You awake, again to violence, this time real, grip rail in hand, hand straining, body not touching bed, ship spinning about you, the heavy energy cells bruising you. One cell barely misses your eye. You ought to have strapped their container down proper. Hell, you should’ve put them in the cargo hold. You told yourself so last night, but you never listen, not even to yourself.

Grab one, it’ll come in usefu— Or don’t. To be fair, you can’t think of much beside the pain in your arm and hand. Your left isn’t your best. You need to switch arms, Leanne. Switch. Now!

Again, you don’t listen. You grunt as you suffer for it. Well, it could be worse: your arm isn’t broken, you don’t think, and besides, you have another.

Instead of switching arms, you simply let go. Stupid. You somehow avoid breaking your neck as you slam into one wall of metal grating and then another. The rough edges dig into your arms, slicing up your skin. Your legs aren’t much better protected. Your knives dig into the thigh upon which they’re strapped. You can feel the wet of your blood. One snaps, and a flash of silver begins to ricochet along with the power cells.

Then your face hits a wall. Your nose— well, what’s a bit of blood? But your vision blurs. If you had just—

Focus. Three, two, one, kick! Thank you! Perfect timing: you fly right to the cockpit door; your hand ensnares the griprail.

Wrong arm! The pain screams at you, but thankfully you are no better listening to it than yourself, and your grip remains unbroken.

You swing up your good arm. Pull!

The gravgen is beneath the console. Careful!

It does not start. Figures. Needs an energy cell. You should’ve grabbed one. It would have come in useful. Luckily, they aren’t hard to find. Well, that’s a libe. But you have a stolen crateful of them ricocheting around your bedroom, and a dozen-odd bruises and cuts to show for it. Today, even you ought to be able to find one.
	
You sling the gravgen over your shoulder. It hits the wall behind you a bit hard, but it should be fine. It was made for military use. Doesn’t even need an Alt to operate. Just as well: even if there was a working Alt in your head, it wouldn’t help you. Alts never helped anyone hurt anyone else, and you’re about to hurt someone. Badly.

The ship’s spin keeps you solidly against the right cockpit wall. Right? There’s a better term, you’re sure, but you don’t know it. You woul— Focus, Leanne. The point is: it’ll serve as gravity well enough, even if it’s twice as strong as gravity ought to be.

Pull yourself out of the cockpit. Duck! A flash of silver misses your face by an inch. The shard of knife bangs off the wall behind you.

Choose: desk, bed, or stay put? You pick the most dangerous. Straddle the cockpit entry. Trust the spin to keep you steady. They won’t ram you again. Probably.

Let go of the griprail. Steady! Above you, a bit to the right; it’ll come into reach in three, two—

The power cell slams into your hand. Your fingers just manage to close around it. The pain isn’t _that_ bad, Leanne, but grunt away if that helps you. You got what you need.

Slam that cell in. Strap on the gravgen. Aim. Power—

You fall to the wall. Aim again, kick the switch, and you fall to the ceiling. You really ought to practice more, but this will do.

A dozen power cells are still darting around. No! Leanne, don’t grab them, not now; you can strap them down later—

Mercifully, you stop.

You can hear them. They’re actually boarding. Bold. Either they’re hunters with a warrant to bring you in alive, or they’re assassins commanded to make it personal. They’re either stupidly idiotic or stupidly skilled.

It’s probably skill. They rammed you, which means they have their own ship. Military model, just like yours; anything else would need an Alt to pilot.

They’ll enter unprotected. Good. They won’t tolerate the vacuum any better than you.

Your hand reaches to your thigh just as your bedroom door opens.

Wait! Don— 

You don’t wait. You throw your knife. Idiot. The gravgen only warps the area just around you. Your knife wildly misses your target.

At least it distracted him. You can’t see his face through his helmet, but his head turns to follow the knife as it bounces off the wall behind your bed.

You grab another knife. Flatten yourself against the wall. Twist the gravgen. Aim. Up the power, kick the switch again— 

Air leaves your lungs as you slam into the wall, and again as your attacker slams into you, right onto your knife.

Two more enter. Same helmets, standard for hunters. They’re gripping the rails; hugging the walls. They don’t have gravgens. They have to make do.

The one to your right locks eyes with you. Turns his gun—

You aim the gravgen at wall behind him. Fire!

You fall at him, but he sees you. He’s going to twist away. Which way? Even you should be able to tell that. His eyes darted over; his right leg dug in. He’ll end up a foot to your left. His right.

Don’t bother with the knife in your hand. Just grab him. Turn him, pull back his head, and— 

A silver shard buries itself in his neck. His blood adds to the stains upon the walls. If you survive you really ought to sterilize the walls. Who knows what’s in his blood? But you’ll forget.

Dive for the bed, now! The bullet would have hit your arm. Instead, it is caught by the wall. At least it doesn’t ricochet.

You kick off the bed, opposite the ship’s spin, and grab the one who shot at you. He had only just been holding on to the grip rail. You spin him around midair. He barely has time to see the wall before his face crunches under your weight. He should’ve worn a helmet like the others. His hand releases his gun, and you catch it.

There are three more in the room. Two will shoot within the next three seconds. Another three or four are boarding. Big party. You won’t have enou— 

You shoot the two before they can shoot you: one in the head; the helmeted one in the neck. You flip the gun around and your pinky shoots the third, behind you. You should grab one of their gu—

The next to enter gets a bullet in her forehead, as does the one after. You need to—

You fire again. Idiot. It’s a revolver. Six shots. What did you expect?

You don’t quite dodge the kick. Their foot hits your face and your head bangs against the wall. Somehow, things begin to spin even more. 

They hadn’t even meant to hit you. They had lost her grip. And now, you’ve lost yours.

You try to aim the gravgen. You aim wrong. Your back slams against the wall. The pressure is immense. They land on your chest; whatever air was in your lungs leaves you.

Knife! Yours; it’s in air. Little more than the hilt of the broken one, but it’ll do, if you can just catch it. Catch it! Please! Three, two—

One hand grabs the knife. The other twists the gravgen and points it at the wall. 

It flings your attacker across the room, you along with them. 

You twist your hand. 

You see the shine of the knife.

It’ll be okay, Leanne.

Darkness.

----

You awake to what remains.

Vision unclear. Lights foggy. You’re laying on the floor. The wall, really.

Bodies surround you. More than you remembered.

Your ship is still spinning. Guns are flying through the air, banging against wall after wall. Most are rather damaged.

Had it been five minutes?

You try to move. Your bruises and black eye tell you that the energy cells and guns have been pelting you incessantly. 

Nothing broken, even if your left arm is nearly useless. Lucky you. Good you bothered to strap everything else down.

Breathe.

You need to stop your ship’s spin. You think of boarding the other ship, but you can do that later. If there was anyone left to attack you, they would have already done so.

Your eyes glance at the cargo hold door. It closed itself. Even if whoever’s left leaves, you should be safe from the vacuum.

The gravgen is working. When you get to the cockpit, you realize it’s the only thing that does.

A pang of fear hits you. It typically takes a machine to repair ships, particularly without an Alt to guide you.

It could be a standard cable. They’re rather rigid, with a tendency to break under strain at the joints. If things would just stop spinning, you could find a replacement.

Fine. Make your way to the other ship. They haven’t left yet. You hope they don’t leave as you board. You still don’t have a suit on. You realize you don’t have much of anything on. Underwear. Shirt. Knives. It’s enough, even if your feet are sliced to hell from walking on the walls.

Your eyebrow raises as you enter their ship. It’s smaller than yours, and yours is little more than a cockpit, a bedroom, and a cargo hold all nestled between four giant engines. How did they all fit in, you wonder? The cots strewn across the floor answer your question.

It’s sleeker than yours. Probably all around better, even if smaller. You pass the turrets. It actually has turrets. They’re lasers, you think. Each with their own power cell. Seems excessive. They must pack quite a punch. Had they fired on your ship, you’d probably be dead, plain and simple.

You see nobody in the cockpit.

Leanne, you know better than that. They wouldn’t ever have left their ship unattended. There has to be someone.

Instead of looking for them, you fiddle with the controls, stopping the spin. Fine, don’t listen. They’ll just stab you in the ba—

Your hand catches theirs just before their knife punctures your side.

You slam them against the wall. The force of it winds them, even without the ship’s spin to back you up.
 
Rip off their helmet. See their eyes. She’s a woman, you think.

“How did you find me?” you demand.

She remains silent.

“Your friends are all dead. You will soon join them,” you tell her. “You lose nothing by telling me.”

For a moment you think she still won’t respond. But then, she glances over towards the airlock.

“What can I gain, then?” she asks.

“I can make it painless. Quick, even,” you offer. You’d do it anyway. Probably.

She reaches for her pocket. Slowly. Your hand tenses, but her gun’s on her other hip, and there isn’t room in the pocket for more than a small knife—too slow to kill you, at any rate.

The woman withdraws a card. Looks like a hunting warrant.

You see your face on it. Coordinates, too. Coordinates? Your breath catches, and something twists in your chest. How—

She hesitates.

“There’s more,” she says. She pulls out another card. “Same warrant.”

On it is another woman. No coordinates; just ‘Dressara.’ Second moon of Seven.

Unusual.

You gently take both cards. They don’t matter much to you. You’re not going to stick around—not if they can track you—and certainly not going anywhere near Dressara. You’ll make your way to one of the other colonized systems, you think. Q729 can do without you.

The woman steels her eyes. Takes a deep breath.

There’s something about the way she talks and moves. She doesn’t have an Alt. Not surprising, really. Not many jobs for the Altless. Most become hunters or assassins. Or both.

She’s ready.

You almost offer to let her live. But you can’t. And even if you did, she couldn’t accept. You can see it on her face. They’d be after her, now, too, after what she told you. Hunters aren’t supposed to talk to their prey.

“I’m sorry,” you tell her.

Your hand grabs the gun hanging at her side. It takes you half a second to move it under her chin and fire.

“I’m sorry,” you repeat. For a moment, you stare at what’s left. Then turn, eventually, away.

You shouldn’t be sorry, Leanne. She wouldn’t have thought twice at killing you.

For once, you make a wise choice: you don’t try to repair your ship yourself.

Instead, you sit in the other ship’s cockpit.

You should go for Eight. You should be able to catch an inter-system transport there. The nearest system should only be twelve or thirteen years away. It’ll be pricy, especially to take your ship with you, but you should have enough.

It’s the safest option. You glance at the coordinates on the warrant card. If they can track you, they’ll certainly track you to Eight. But with any luck, you’ll have already left by then, and even if they manage to get a message to the transport it’s unlikely anyone onboard will care.

Your hands reach for the ship’s computer.

You hesitate.

No, Leanne. Don’t, it’s not—

Sigh. It’s no use. You don’t listen.

You’ll arrive in Dressara in about thirteen hours.

It would be sooner. Their ship’s engines aren’t meant to move two ships. But you’re not leaving _your_ ship behind.
