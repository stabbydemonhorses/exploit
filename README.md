Exploit: She woke up three years ago with no memory. Now she's an assassin who flies a spaceship. And she's about to fall in love.

## Unicorn's Notes
She also happens to be trans, but I'm not sure how/when that comes up in the story, yet. When she woke up with no memory, she was, in effect, no longer trans (the body she woke up with was a new one, and matched her gender identity, and she had no memory of the old one).

However, although she has no explicit memory, her unremembered past still influences her present actions. In addition, as she learns about her past, she will learn that her body used to be one that others perceived as male, and that did not feel right to her.

While she doesn't explicitly remember that she was getting a replacement body, and that she then woke up "wrong" (without memory), she does have this feeling that whenever she tries to fix something, it always ends up broken some other way, inspiring a bit of a defeatist attitude in her. And yet, I can't let her give up.

This is informed by my own experience: I had a major procedure and woke up with some pretty major nerve issues in my arms and hands.
