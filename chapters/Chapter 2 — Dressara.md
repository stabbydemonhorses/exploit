The women of Dressara often wore dresses, which Leanne both admired and found a shame. Leanne enjoyed wearing dresses, but found women in suits much more handsome.

Delphine was nothing if not handsome. She was tall, and did her best to look so: her fine Elisian suit lengthened her torso, and she had paired it, rather than with pants, with a skirt just long enough to wave gently in the light breeze the Dressarans were so fond of.

Dressara was a large moon. It was somewhat pleasant, if you enjoyed their sort of pomp, unlike the dour planet Seven around which it held a lazy orbit. Like anywhere else, it was rather difficult to land on illegally, particularly when it was in the process of adjusting its orbit. 

It was simpler to land legally. While Leanne didn’t have an Alt to identify her, nor to pilot her ship, she did have a collection of bounty cards for people on all the various planets and moons. Their targets were now long dead, but so long as the bodies weren’t found, Leanne could use their bounties to land (bounties did not expire).

There only a few thousand inhabitants on Dressara, plus their few thousand servants. There was a party nearly every day, and everyone was invited—sometimes the servants, too. The men, Leanne knew, did little more than stand about all day, whether at parties or at home. They were utterly boring, both as people and as targets. The women, Leanne, assumed, did something more than simply wear dresses and stroll about—even the wealthy had to bring in money somehow—but whatever they did, it wasn’t interesting enough for Leanne to learn what it was. 

But if any Dressaran woman—or, for that matter, any Dressaran at all—were ever to do anything interesting, Leanne would bet it would be Delphine. 

Leanne looked away as Delphine approached. Her neck muscles tensed, her back straightened, her eyes glanced down—

She jumped as a hand tapped her bare shoulder.

“My apologies,” said a deep, melodic voice. “I didn’t mean to startle you.”

It was Delphine. Leanne tore her eyes from her lips—halfway between smile and smirk, just as Leanne had seen before, and there was no mistaking that dark lipstick—up to Delphine’s eyes, kind and stalwart, framed by her short black hair.

“A red,” Delphine instructed. “Merlot.”

Leanne nodded readily. Her heat beat unevenly as she felt herself move towards the back of the garden, where the bar was.

She had considered inviting herself to the garden party. She’d done as much before: the security at Dressaran parties was nonexistent: Dressarans tended to assume they were safe at all times. If they didn’t recognize her, they’d assume their Alt was forgetful. They’d make smalltalk just fine, and be friendly enough.

But while Dressarans rarely had much of substance to say, when they did, they generally only shared it with those they knew. Even those that recognized Leanne from her previous intrusions would not feel so comfortable around her.

Servants, however, were generally invisible. Their clothing depended on the party; today, they wore shimmering gray tunics held up by silvery strings that snaked over their shoulders.  

Leanne shivered as she poured the wine. She was unused to exposing so much skin to the elements. The artificial wind tickled the scar upon her shoulder, the scar Delphine had tapped, the scar Leanne had received on the moon Delphinia after thirty seven assassins had cornered her. 

She assumed Delphine was named after Delphinia. As much as the Dressarans looked down upon the other planets and moons, they frequently named their children after them: “Delphine,” “Delphy,” “Elise,” “Elsa.”

Elsa was Delphine, Leanne assumed. She looked different now, of course. Her face had been soft, now it was angular. Her hair long and red, now short and black. But there was no mistaking her.

She hadn’t been hard to track down. She’d only changed Face once. Faces records could only be unsealed with a half-dozen odd warrants, but Leanne didn’t need the records: while Leanne didn’t think she was all that great at tracking people down through their identity changes, she had to acknowledge that she was far better at it than any of her peers. She often hardly needed to research; she’d simply guess what people would do with their new identities, and frequently, she’d be right. 

Leanne had guessed Dressaran woman like Delphine wouldn’t miss out on the lavish parties her relations threw, even if she would now have to attend as a guest in order not to be associated with her former self and her former scandals. She had been right.

“Ma’am,” said Leanne, eyes downcast, as she handed Delphine her glass of wine. Delphine was on the outskirts of the party, observing from the distance. Leanne guessed she was wistful about a past she could never fully rejoin. Then again, if Dressara were her past, Leanne wouldn’t want to rejoin it.

Delphine took the glass, her fingers winding around it delicately, her deep red fingernails clicking gently against it.

She looked at Leanne, glanced her up and down. The corner of her lips turned up a bit further.

“You look stunning, obviously,” said Leanne.

A soft chuckle escaped Delphine. “Obviously,” she agreed. “Not that you’ve done poorly with yourself.”

“I’m not different than the others,” said Leanne, nodding her head towards the other servants, who were attending a loud crowd of walking primping Dressaran men.

Delphine glanced at the others, and back at Leanne. “I don’t think so.” Her smirk faded a bit as she glanced at the blood red of her fingernails. “Not that theres’s anything wrong with them, they’re just…”

Her eyes hardened and turned to Leanne. “Not you.”

Leanne’s breath wanted to catch. “Not me, no.”

“Then who are you?” asked Delphine, closing the distance between them. “Why come here as a servant? They wouldn’t know the difference if you came as Queen of Dressara.” 

Leanne thought that might be a bit of a stretch. Dressara had never had a queen—neither had any planet in Q729.

“You knew the difference,” said Leanne.

“I’m not from Dressara,” said Delphine.

“Yes, you are,” said Leanne.

Delphine’s smirk returned. “So, you’re here for me?”

Leanne had faced many larger and taller than even Delphine, but something about her made Leanne’s chest tighten and her breath quiver.

“So to speak,” said Leanne.

“Well, introduce yourself,” said Delphine. 

“Leanne.” What else could she say? She didn’t know where she was from. She couldn’t say what she did. ‘Assassin?’ ‘Pilot?’ ‘Bounty hunter,’ perhaps—it would at least be legal, and moderately truthful.

“And you know me,” said Delphine.

“I know what your parents named you.”

Delphine shrugged her shoulders. Her suit lifted up. Her shirt was untucked, the skin beneath it—

“So do I,” said Delphine. “Hardly makes you special.”

“I could be here to kill you,” said Leanne.

“You _should_ be here to kill me,” said Delphine. “Yet you are not.”

“Does that make me special?”

“Perhaps.”
