The women of Dressara often wore dresses, which Leanne both admired and found a shame. Leanne enjoyed wearing dresses, but found women in suits much more handsome.

Delphine was nothing if not handsome. She was tall, and did her best to look so: her fine Elisian suit lengthened her body, and she had paired it, rather than with pants, with a skirt just long enough to wave gently in the light breeze the Dressarans were so fond of.

Dressara was a large moon; somewhat pleasant, if you enjoyed their sort of pomp, unlike the dour planet Seven around which it held its lazy orbit. 

Like anywhere else, it was nearly impossible to land on illegally. The traffic around Dressara lately was particularly chaotic: the planet’s orbit was currently being altered, which wasn’t an issue in its own right; however, all of its many satellites required adjustment to match, and there had apparently been an abundance of issues. Many of the satellites had required replacement of energy cells to power their shift, but several energy cell shipments allocated for them had mysteriously gone missing—a few of them conveniently making their way into Leanne’s ship.

All this had necessitated Seven to perform the Exploit for the second time in an Earth year, and while it had generated enough energy to move a dozen planets and their satellites, it had of course gravitational consequences of its own.

Even under normal conditions, however, Dressara still had the same double-layered defense system as anywhere else. It was simpler to land legally.

While Leanne didn’t have an Alt to identify her, nor to navigate her ship around the mess of traffic around Dressasra, she did have a collection of bounty cards for people on all the various planets and moons. Their targets were now long dead, but so long as their bodies weren’t found, Leanne could use their bounties to request both permission to land and an opening in the mess through which to do so. Unlike warrant cards, bounty cards did not expire, which wasn’t only a convenience, but a necessity, given Leanne’s penchant for using her gravity field generator, which had the unfortunate side effect of messing with the cards’ internal clocks, even with its relatively gentle manipulation of spacetime (Leanne still didn’t fully comprehend how this happened, but since almost being sent to the prisons on Nine after an incident on Lyona, she accepted it).

Dressara was inhabited only by a few thousand people, plus each of their few thousand servants. There was a party nearly daily, and everyone was invited—sometimes the servants, too. The men, Leanne knew, did little more than stand about all day, whether at parties or at home. They were utterly boring both as individuals and as targets. The women, Leanne assumed, did something more than simply wear dresses and stroll about—even the wealthy had to bring in more money somehow—but whatever they did, it wasn’t interesting for Leanne to learn what it was.

But if any Dressaran woman—or, for that matter, any Dressaran at all—were ever to do anything remotely interesting, Leanne would bet it would be Delphine.

Delphine was Leanne’s target, Leanne assumed. She looked different now, of course. On the Leesome’s card, her name hadn’t been Delphine. Her face had been soft, now it was angular; her hair long and red, now short and black. But there was no mistaking her.

She hadn’t been hard to track down. She’d only changed Face once. Faces records could only be unsealed with a half-dozen odd warrants, but Leanne didn’t need the records: while she didn’t think she was all that great at tracking people through their identity changes, she had to acknowledge that she was better at it than any of her peers. She often hardly needed to research: she’d simply guess what people would do with their new identities, and frequently, she’d be right.

Leanne had guessed a Dressaran woman like Delphine wouldn’t miss out on the lavish parties her relations threw, even if she would now have to attend as a guest in order not to be associated with herself and her former scandals.

It was unlikely Leanne would learn much from this excursion. Delphine was Dressaran, after all, and almost certainly knew nothing of use. Still, if Leanne was lucky, she could learn something useful, and maybe she’d have some fun, too— not necessarily in that order. And if nothing else, she could at least still do the job and collect the reward.

Delphine approached. Leanne looked away. Her neck muscles tensed, back straightened, eyes glanced down—

She jumped as a hand tapped her bare shoulder.

“My apologies,” said Delphine’s deep, melodic voice. “I didn’t mean to startle you.”

Leanne tore her eyes away from Delphine’s lips—halfway between smile and smirk, just as she had seen before, and there was no mistaking the lipstick–up to Delphine’s eyes, kind and stalwart, framed by her short black hair.

“A red,” Delphine instructed. “Syrah. From Earth, not the Lyonan nonsense.”

Leanne nodded readily. Her heart beat unevenly as she felt herself move towards the far end of the garden where the bar was.

She had considered inviting herself to the garden party. She’d done as much before: the security at Dressaran parties was nonexistent. Dressarans tended to assume they were safe at all times. If they didn’t recognize her, they’d assume their alt was forgetful. They’d make smalltalk just fine, and be friendly enough.

But while Dressarans rarely had much of substance to say, when they did, they generally only shared it with those they knew well. Even those that recognized Leanne from her previous intrusions would not feel so comfortable around her.

Servants, however, were generally invisible. Their clothing varied by the party; today, they wore shimmering gray tunics held up by silvery strings that snaked over their shoulders.

Leanne shivered as she poured the wine. She was unused to exposing so much skin to the elements. The artificial wind tickled the scar upon her shoulder, the scar Delphine had tapped, the scar Leanne had received on the moon Delphinia after thirty seven assassins had cornered her.

She assumed Delphine was named after Delphinia. As much as Dressarans looked down upon the other planets and moons, they frequently named their children after them: “Delphine,” “Lyon,” “Tria,” “Elsa.”

“Ma’am,” said Leanne, eyes downcast, as she handed Delphine her glass of wine. Delphine was on the outskirts of the party, observing from a paved path near one of the rear doors of the house—Leanne forgot whose. She guessed Delphine was wistful about a past she could never fully rejoin. Then again, if Dressara were her past, Leanne wouldn’t want to rejoin it.

Delphine took the glass, her fingers winding around it delicately, her deep red fingernails clicking gently against it.

She looked at Leanne. Glanced her up and down. The corner of her lips turned up a bit further.

“You look stunning, obviously,” said Leanne.

A soft chuckle escaped Delphine. “Obviously,” she agreed. “Not that you’ve done poorly with yourself.”

“I’m not different from the others,” said Leanne, nodding her head towards the other servants, who were attending a loud crowd of walking primping Dressaran men.

Delphine glanced at the others, and back at Leanne. “I don’t think so.” Her smirk faded a bit as she glanced at the blood red of her fingernails. “Not that there’s anything wrong with them, they’re just…”

Her eyes hardened and turned to Leanne. “Not you.”

Leanne’s breath wanted to catch. “Not me, no.”

“Then who are you,” asked Delphine, closing the distance between them. “Why come here as a servant? They wouldn’t know the difference if you came as Queen of Dressara.”

Leanne thought that might be a bit of a stretch. Dressara had never had a queen. Neither had any planet in Q729, although Leanne supposed that could change if the secessionists’ futile dream ever came true.

“You knew the difference,” said Leanne.

“I’m not from Dressara,” said Delphine.

“Yes, you are,” said Leanne.

Delphine’s smirk returned. “So, you’re here for me?”

Leanne had faced many larger and taller than even Delphine, but something about her made Leanne’s chest tighten and her breath quiver.

“So to speak,” said Leanne. She looked to the side. Tried to count what she saw: two stones in the grass; a tree; three branches; yellow lights of the party, glittering in Delphine’s brown eyes—

“Well, introduce yourself,” said Delphine.

Leanne took a breath. Straightened her back. Looked up into those thinking eyes.

“Leanne,” she said.

What else could she say? Leanne didn’t know where she was from. She couldn’t say what she did. ‘Assassin?’ ‘Pilot?’ ‘Bounty hunter,’ perhaps—it would at least be legal, and sometimes it was even truthful.

“And you know me,” said Delphine, bringing the wine glass up between them and taking a sip.

“I know you’re from Dressara,” said Leane. It had been on the card. Delphine was Dressaran, and there oughtn’t be anything interesting about her.

“My _parents_ were from Dressara,” said Delphine. She glanced down at her drink, her brow furrowing just slightly. Then, back to Leanne.

Leanne raised an eyebrow. She took a small step forward, tentatively pushing Delphine against the mahogany door of the house. It must have been imported from Earth; the door alone must be worth—

“And you?” Leanne asked.

“Somewhere else,” said Delphine, leaning away from Leanne, her head tilted slightly back, her voice almost lost in the noise from the party in the yard, a small smile tugging at her lips.

“That’s not what I’ve read,” said Leanne, placing her hands against the door either side of Delphine, leaning over her yet still looking up into her eyes. She pulled the Leesomes’ card from beneath her tunic, not breaking her gaze.

The corner of Delphine’s lips tugged upwards again. Leanne thought she saw a brief glimpse of surprise flash across Delphine’s face as she glanced at the card, but it had been hard to be certain. Leanne’s lungs had again tightened, and—

Delphine brought the wine up to her lips once again, snaking her arm around Leanne’s, and took a long sip.

“Hardly looks like me,” she said. “Perhaps you have me mistaken.”

“There’s no mistaking you, I’m sure,” said Leanne. “Even if you have changed name and face.”

Delphine smiled, almost with a hint of wistfulness, and Leanne felt herself taken aback. She knew people generally changed face to erase past scandals, but for some reason, she was always surprised for their fondness for how others previously knew them.

“Well then,” said Delphine. “What else do you think you know about me?”

Delphine pulled herself away from the wall, standing to her full height. Leanne met her gaze, forcing herself not to flinch away.

“I know what your parents named you,” said Leanne. Assuming, once more, that the records were accurate.

Delphine shrugged her shoulders, glancing away, almost smugly. Her suit lifted up. Her shirt was untucked, the skin beneath it—

“So do I,” said Delphine. “Hardly makes you special.”

“And what if I’m here to kill you?” asked Leanne, reaching a hand down to the hem of her tunic, where, for all Delphine knew, she could have a knife (in fact she had a small collection, but she generally only needed one).

“Strangers always are,” said Delphine, meeting Leanne’s gaze once more. “Still not special.”

“And what if I wasn’t?” asked Leanne. “What if…”

Her heart banged against her chest. Fuck, interrogate, or kill? Perhaps all three, perhaps in that order, and perhaps it didn’t matter, and perhaps she didn’t care.

She collected all the pride she could find as the music from the party swelled. Held out a hand. Looked again into Delphine’s eyes.

“What if all I want, for the present, is a dance?” asked Leanne, forcing herself to let the words out smoothly, struggling not to look away.

“Me, dance with a servant?” asked Delphine. “A Dressaran would never lower herself.”

“You’re not Dressaran,” said Leanne.

Delphine’s smile twitched. Leanne felt herself smile in return, and felt boldness rush into her chest.

“If all I want for the evening is to dance with a woman as obviously stunning as yourself… Would I be special then?”

Delphine’s smirk unfolded into a small, sweet smile. Her hand grabbed Leanne’s.

“Perhaps.”
