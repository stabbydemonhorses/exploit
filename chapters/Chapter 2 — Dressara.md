# Chapter 2: Dressara
Leanne restrained herself from pacing. There was little room for it, anyway.

The room was constructed of cement walls meters thick, reinforced with something or other. It could probably withstand a runaway Exploit. It would certainly hold her ship, one wall over.

She shivered. Her small silvery tunic exposed more skin to the elements than she would like, but should be similar enough to what the servants at the party were wearing for the Dressarans not to notice.

The room beeped. Leanne’s hand dropped to her side, then relaxed.

She pulled a card from beneath her tunic and inserted it into a slot in the wall.

The room beeped again. The wall ejected the card. Leanne felt herself tense.

It ought to have worked. Bounty cards remained valid unless they were cancelled, which generally only occurred if their targets were brought in or found. Leanne was fairly certain this target’s remains wouldn’t ever be found by anyone, even if they knew where to look.

The card had _just_ worked a few minutes previously to get her from the hanger into the holding room, and a few minutes before that to get her authorization to land in the hanger to begin with.

Leanne looked at the card again. Her muscles tightened— it was the Leesomes’ card, marking ‘Elsa’ for assassination. Assassination wasn’t quite legal. Thankfully, the machine hadn’t seemed to have noticed.

She shoved it back beneath her tunic, and fished out the right card: a bounty for a Dressaran man whose body had never been turned in for its reward.

The room beeped again, but less harshly. The heavy door ground open.

She descended the stairs, taking extra care with the last one—it never met the ground quite right.

As soon as her feet were on the grass, the mobile hanger lifted itself back into the sky, its gravity engines humming quietly beneath the light Dressaran wind. More traditional propulsion would have damaged the grass, Leanne supposed. 

She guessed the mobile hangers were tested enough and automated enough to be allowed the immense amount of energy required to power their engines. They probably consumed a crate of energy cells weekly—a quantity of energy no human was generally trusted with.

It was late. Seven was already setting. The sun wouldn’t be far behind.

The trip down had taken longer than she had anticipated. The traffic must have been chaotic, likely due to Seven’s still-in-progress orbit change. The change should’ve been completed a week ago. There had been several issues; the missing shipments of energy cells likely hadn’t helped.

Leanne had only stolen half of the missing cells. She supposed someone else must have gotten the rest. She had been hired to destroy them, but ultimately, what was the difference?

----

The women of Dressara often wore dresses, which Leanne both admired and found a shame. Leanne enjoyed wearing dresses, but found women in suits much more handsome.

Delphine was nothing if not handsome. She was tall, and did her best to look so: her fine Elisian suit lengthened her body, and she had paired it, rather than with pants, with a skirt just long enough to wave gently in the light breeze the Dressarans were so fond of.

Dressara was the larger of Seven’s two moons. It was pleasant enough if you liked their sort of pomp, unlike Seven itself, which was quite dour.

The moon was inhabited only by a few thousand people, plus each of their few thousand servants. There was a party nearly daily, and everyone was invited—sometimes the servants, too. The men, Leanne knew, did little more than stand about all day, whether at parties or at home. The women, Leanne assumed, did something more than simply wear their dresses and stroll about—even the wealthy had to bring in more money somehow—but whatever they did, it was never interesting enough for Leanne to learn what it was.

But if any Dressaran woman—or, for that matter, any Dressaran at all—were ever to do anything remotely interesting, Leanne would bet it would be Delphine.

Delphine was the target, Leanne assumed. She looked different now, of course. On the Leesomes’ card, her name hadn’t been Delphine. Her face had been soft, now it was angular; her hair long and red, now short and black. But there was no mistaking her.

She’d probably only changed face once. Faces records could only be unsealed with a half-dozen odd warrants, but Leanne hadn’t needed the records: while she didn’t think she was all that great at tracking people through their identity changes, she had to acknowledge she was better at it than any of her peers. She often hardly needed to research. It was generally easy enough to guess what people would do with their new identities.

Leanne had guessed that a Dressaran woman like Delphine wouldn’t miss out on the lavish parties her relations so often threw, even if she would now have to attend as a guest in order not to be associated with whatever scandals lay in her past.

It was unlikely Leanne would learn much from this excursion. Delphine was Dressaran, after all, and almost certainly knew nothing of use. Still, if Leanne was lucky, she could learn something useful, and maybe she’d have some fun, too— not necessarily in that order. And if nothing else, she could at least do the job and collect the rather substantial reward.

Leanne looked away. Delphine was approaching. Leanne’s neck muscles tensed, back straightened, eyes glanced down—

She jumped as a hand tapped her bare shoulder.

“My apologies,” said Delphine’s deep, melodic voice. “I didn’t mean to startle you.”

Leanne tore her eyes away from Delphine’s lips—halfway between smile and smirk, just as she had seen before, and there was no mistaking the lipstick—up to Delphine’s eyes, kind and stalwart, framed by her short black hair.

“A red,” Delphine instructed. “Syrah. From Earth, not the Lyonan nonsense.”

Leanne nodded readily. Her heart beat unevenly as she felt herself move towards the far end of the garden where the bar was.

She had considered inviting herself to the garden party. The security at Dressaran parties was laughable. They tended to assume they were safe at all times. If they didn’t recognize her, they’d assume their Alt was forgetful. They’d make smalltalk just fine, and be friendly enough.

But while Dressarans rarely had much of substance to say, when they did, they generally only shared it with those they knew well. Even those that recognized Leanne from her previous intrusions would not feel so comfortable around her. Servants, however, were generally invisible.

Leanne shivered as she poured the wine. The artificial wind tickled the scar upon her shoulder, the scar Delphine had tapped, the scar Leanne had received on the moon Delphinia after thirty seven assassins had cornered her.

She assumed Delphine was named after Delphinia. As much as Dressarans looked down upon the other planets and moons, they frequently named their children after them: “Delphine,” “Lyon,” “Tria,” “Elsa.”

“Ma’am,” said Leanne, eyes downcast, as she handed Delphine her glass of wine. Delphine was on the outskirts of the party, observing from a paved path near one of the rear doors of the house—Leanne forgot whose. She guessed Delphine was wistful for a past she could never fully rejoin. Then again, if Dressara were _her_ past, Leanne wouldn’t want to rejoin it.

Delphine took the glass, her fingers winding about it delicately, her deep red fingernails clicking gently against it.

She looked at Leanne. Glanced her up and down. The corner of her lips turned up a bit further.

“You look stunning, obviously,” Leanne heard herself say.

A soft chuckle escaped Delphine. “Obviously,” she agreed. “Not that you’ve done poorly for yourself.”

“I’m not different from the others,” said Leanne, nodding her head towards the other servants, who were busy attending a loud crowd of primping Dressaran men.

Delphine glanced at them, and back at Leanne. “I don’t think so.” Her smirk faded a bit as she glanced at the wine in her hand. “Not that there’s anything wrong with them. They’re just…”

Her eyes hardened and turned back to Leanne. “Not you.”

Leanne’s breath wanted to catch. “Not me, no.”

“Then who are you?” asked Delphine, closing the distance between them. “Why come here as a servant? They wouldn’t know the difference if you came as Queen of Dressara.”

Leanne thought that might be a bit of a stretch. Dressara had never had a queen. Neither had any planet in Q729, although Leanne supposed that could change if the secessionists’ futile dreams ever came true.

“You knew the difference,” said Leanne.

“I’m not from Dressara,” said Delphine.

“Yes, you are,” said Leanne.

Delphine’s smirk returned. “So, you’re here for me?”

Leanne had faced many larger and taller than even Delphine, but something about her made Leanne’s chest tighten and her breath quiver.

“So to speak,” said Leanne. She looked to the side. Tried to count what she saw: two stones in the grass; a tree; three branches; yellow lights of the party, glittering in Delphine’s brown eyes—

“Well, introduce yourself,” said Delphine.

Leanne took a breath. Straightened her back. Looked up into those sparkling eyes.

“Leanne,” she said.

What else could she say? Leanne didn’t know where she was from. She could hardly say what she did. ‘Assassin?’ ‘Pilot?’ ‘Bounty hunter,’ perhaps—it would at least be legal, and sometimes it would even be the truth.

“And you know me,” said Delphine, bringing the wine up between them and taking a long, deliberate sip.

“I know you’re from Dressara,” said Leanne. It had been on the card. Delphine was Dressaran, and there oughtn’t be a thing interesting about her.

“My _parents_ were from Dressara,” said Delphine. She glanced down at her drink, her brow furrowing just slightly. Then, back to Leanne.

Leanne raised an eyebrow. Took a small step forward. Tentatively pushed Delphine against the mahogany door of the house. It must’ve been imported from Earth; the door alone must be worth—

“And you?” Leanne asked.

“Somewhere else,” said Delphine, leaning away from Leanne, her head tilted slightly back, her voice almost lost in the noise of the party, a small smile tugging not quite reluctantly at her lips.

“That’s not what I’ve read,” said Leanne, placing her palms against the door either side of Delphine, leaning over her yet still looking up into her eyes. She pulled the card from beneath her tunic—the right one, the Leesomes’—not breaking her gaze.

The corner of Delphine’s lips tugged upwards again. Leanne thought she caught a brief glimpse of surprise flash across Delphine’s face as she glanced at the card, but it had been hard to be certain: Leanne’s lungs had again tightened, and—

Delphine brought the wine up to her lips once again, snaking her arm around Leanne’s.

“Hardly looks like me,” she said. “Perhaps you have me mistaken.”

“There’s no mistaking you, I’m sure,” said Leanne. “Even if you have changed name and face.”

Delphine smiled, almost with a hint of wistfulness, and Leanne felt herself taken aback. She knew people generally changed face to erase past scandals, but for some reason, she was always surprised at their fondness for how others previously knew them.

“Well then,” said Delphine, “what else do you think you know about me?”

Delphine pulled herself away from the wall, standing to her full height. Leanne met her gaze—Delphine was easily a foot taller—and forced herself not to flinch away.

“I know what your parents named you,” said Leanne. Assuming, once more, that the information from the card had been accurate.

Delphine shrugged her shoulders. She glanced away—smugly, Leanne thought. Her suit lifted up. Her shirt was untucked, the dark skin beneath it was—

“So do I,” said Delphine. “Hardly makes you special.”

“And what if I’m here to kill you?” asked Leanne, reaching a hand down to the hem of her tunic, where, for all Delphine knew, she could have a knife (in fact she had a small collection, but generally she needed only one).

“Strangers always are,” said Delphine, meeting Leanne’s stare once more. “Still not special.”

“And what if I wasn’t?” asked Leanne. “What if…”

Her heart banged against her chest. Fuck, interrogate, or kill? Perhaps all three, perhaps in that order, and perhaps it didn’t matter, and perhaps she didn’t care.

She collected all the pride she could find as the party’s music swelled. Held out a hand. Looked again into Delphine’s eyes.

“What if all I want, for the moment, is a dance?” asked Leanne, forcing the words out smoothly, struggling not to look away.

“Me, dance with a servant?” asked Delphine. “A Dressaran would never lower herself.”

“You’re not Dressaran,” said Leanne.

Delphine’s smile twitched. Leanne felt herself smile in return, and felt boldness rush into her chest.

“If all I, a stranger, want for the evening… is to dance with a woman as obviously stunning as yourself… Would I be special then?”

Delphine’s smirk unfolded into a small, sweet smile. Her hand grabbed Leanne’s.

“Perhaps.”

----

Delphine shoved her against the wall; Leanne heard the thump of the door closing behind them somewhere in the distance. 

Shivers shook down her sides as Delphine’s hands brushed them, the silvery fabric rippling underneath them. They reached Leanne’s thighs; gripped the hilt of one of her knives—

Delphine smiled. Pleased? Excited? She followed Delphine’s eyes down, then back. Leanne’s breath quickened.

Delphine pulled on the knife, through the fabric. It snapped easily from Leanne’s custom-printed holster. 

Leanne felt its tip trace against her thigh. She swallowed. A shiver reverberated through her; her hands twitched, ready for— 

But Delphine glanced down at her: questioning, and for the first time unsure. 

“Want?” Delphine asked.

Leanne smiled back, a different sort of shiver now traveling through her. She steadied her hands. Placed them tentatively upon Delphine’s thighs. Delphine sunk into them, a quiet breath escaping her.

“Want,” said Leanne, firmly.

A brief, giddy smile flashed across Delphine’s face. She turned her head away, struggled to compose herself, biting her lip a bit, and Leanne felt herself inching forwards…

“Wait,” said Delphine. “I have to—“

She drew herself away, breathing in little laughs. Placed the knife on the bed. Tore at the buttons of her shirt. Leanne’s heart beat—

A small gold chain dangled around Delphine’s neck. Between her breasts, hanging upon the chain, rested a small, sheathed knife.

Leanne slowly reached towards it. Delphine shook her head. 

“Maybe later,” she said, after a brief moment. She unhooked the knife from the chain. A small golden key remained. She disentangled herself from Leanne, and walked over to a dresser.

Leanne hadn’t really noticed the room. It was Delphine’s, she assumed. It was smaller than she would have expected: just enough room for the bed, its lonely nightstand, and the tall dresser with its locked cabinet.

They all looked incredibly old; their polished dark wood contrasted against the smooth bright wood of the floor, and they were far more ornate than the simple clean design Dressarans generally preferred in their Earthen antiques— but then, Delphine wasn’t Dressaran.

Delphine unlocked the cabinet with her key, turning the lock from vertical to horizontal. She gingerly placed her knife upon a stand amongst various other Earthen antiques, many of them weapons, including a long, curved sword and no less than two ancient guns—revolvers, Leanne assumed.

The knife must mean a lot to Delphine, Leanne thought, or else it must be poisoned— or perhaps both.

Locking the door once more—turning the key from horizontal to vertical—Delphine turned back to Leanne. 

The golden key shone against her brown skin. Leanne struggled to bring her eyes back up to Delphine’s. Her lips felt dry.

She reached for her own knife, still on the bed—it was her favorite one, and if it wasn’t, it was now—and she held it out, a cheeky smile blooming upon her face.

Delphine began to reach for it, nearly breaking out in a grin, nearly making Leanne’s heart leap.

“You’ll tell me if it’s too much?” Delphine asked.

“I will.”

“Good.”

“And you?” asked Leanne.

“Of course,” said Delphine. 

She held out her hand. Leanne took a breath. 

The shiver flowed through her again as she placed the knife in Delphine’s hand.

Delphine’s fingers closed around its hilt. She lifted it. Felt its weight. Thumbed its edge.

Not so sharp. Not too dull. Just right for this.

She turned back to Leanne. Took a step forward.

Leanne felt herself fall onto the bed, its softness folding in around her.

She felt Delphine climb atop her; the knife’s blade touch her skin— and the world swum, gently, away.

----

Seven rose just as it had set: early. Its dim light shone through the open shutters. Even with Dressara’s longer cycle, Leanne was certain she had not slept enough. Some of that was undoubtedly her own fault, and some of it had certainly been Delphine’s, in whose arms and sheets she was still tangled.

Delphine was snoring just audibly, and Leanne couldn’t suppress a little smile. The night had been long; the morning longer.

What woke her? It was hard to tell. She didn’t usually wake until fully rested, but she also didn’t usually share a bed.

Her head turned abruptly to the window. She scanned the sky. It was a clear dawn, smoothly gray with hints of purple and green.

Her eyes skimmed the walls—nothing—over to the door. Closed.

The air was crisp and fresh, as Dressaran morning air always was. There was a tiny smell of berries. The kitchen was likely preparing breakfast. She glanced at Delphine—still snoring, head snuggled into pillow, dark skin against a bright white halo; Leanne again smiled. Perhaps they’d have their breakfast in bed—

A snap from outside— but it was only a squirrel. It peeked in through the windows and tilted its head, a nut held between its paws. It skittered off.

Leanne felt her hand twitch.

Her eyes glanced to the floor. Her collection of knives lay amongst the piles of clothing, largely haphazardly but for a couple set aside for cleaning after last night’s play. Leanne brushed a fond finger across her chest, where she could still feel the knife’s marks; a little, giggly smile forced its way onto her face…

She pulled herself up gently, leaving a calming hand on Delphine’s arm. She glanced at the cabinet across the room.

Leanne had admired how its key had shone against Delphine’s—

She swallowed.

Her eyes darted around the room.

No gold.

Not resting where it belonged upon Delphine’s chest. Not sitting atop the nightstand. Not dropped within the sheets, not laying upon the floor—

The key was gone.

The cabinet: closed. The lock…

Horizontal. Unlocked.

The room was still.

Delphine had stopped snoring.

A flash—

Delphine leapt from the bed, bringing up the sheets and twisting; a knife flew across the room, past the man hovering at the foot of the bed—

Leanne recognized him: he called himself “Elsar”—a silly name, Leanne thought—and was a proud member of the “golden” generation of assassins: rather large, but not all that tall; physically strong, mentally competent but often irritable. 

He had a reputation for making his kills appear as accidents. Delphine’s knife would’ve accomplished that perfectly, particularly given the activities she and Leanne had engaged themselves in during the night.

Elsar must have watched them. Leanne’s furor flared.

His hand shot out and grasped Delphine’s neck. She grasped his wrist and twisted.

He screamed and yanked his wrist away. Typical. He had a habit of underestimating his opponents. He only ever took the easy kills, and had decided that therefore all kills must be easy.

Leanne stood. She remained steady, even as the soft bed sunk beneath her feet.

Elsar looked from Delphine to Leanne. He did not seem surprised to see her.

He leapt across the bed, straight at Leanne. She dropped against the downy comforter, letting him fly over—

He twisted around inflight. His foot missed her face by a half an inch.

He landed in a backroll, grabbing a knife on the way—one of the dirty ones; Leanne’s mouth twitched angrily.

She ripped the sheets from the bed. Delphine, it seemed, had the same idea.

They dove at Elsar, the sheet stretched between them. He lashed out with the knife. It tore at the sheet, but as one of the safer knives from Leanne’s collection, it didn’t slice through as much as he had likely hoped.

Leanne felt Delphine’s side of the sheet drop, but did not let her focus waver.

She flicked the sheet up around Elsar; he tried to duck under, but got his face stuck within it.

She leapt backwards. Pulled the sheet. Hard. His head yanked towards the bed.

His fist reached out for Leanne. A grunt escaped him.

She twisted away. Not quick enough. His fist met her left arm.

Leanne grunted. Her arm didn’t break, she thought. Good: it should be safe enough to use.

She snapped her arm back. Grasped his hair. Reached her right arm around him. Grabbed his shoulder.

In the corner of her eye, she saw a flash; she pulled anyway—

He lurched just before his neck snapped.

Leanne released him.

He fell to the floor. The soft thump of his body against the wood echoed around the room, beneath the chirping of the birds outside.

Delphine’s mouth was hanging open. She looked—

“You killed him,” she said. “You fucking—“

“_You_ stabbed him,” said Leanne. “And he was trying to—“

“He wouldn’t have died!” said Delphine. She bent down, grasped the knife, and yanked it from Elsar’s shoulder. “Not right away, anyway.“

Delphine stood. Leanne’s eyes moved from the knife—blood dripped from it down to the floor—back to Delphine’s face, inscrutable.

“He wouldn’t have told you who hired him,” said Leanne. “He wouldn’t have known anywa—“

“I am aware,” Delphine ground out.

She stared at Leanne. Turned her gaze to the knife. Then, back to Leanne.

With a calming sigh, she knelt again next to Elsar’s body. Placed the knife on the floor. Began searching him.

“He won’t have much on him,” said Leanne.

“He has this,” said Delphine, pulling a card from one of his pockets. 

“Like yours,” she said. Same yellow insignia. Same name. Same face.

Leanne raised a cool eyebrow. She was unsure why Delphine would be surprised. Multiple assassins were often given the same target. It raised the chances that the job would be done.

Delphine walked to the dresser. Opened the cabinet. Pulled open a drawer.

“It’s not a match for this,” she said, withdrawing a small card of her own. It did not have a yellow eagle, but instead, a red dragon. The Rosens. Leanne dealt with them sometimes. They were professional enough.

Delphine handed over the card. Upon it was Delphine’s face, her current one, along with her current name, and even where to find her.

And it was the card of the client, not the assassin. _She_ had hired—

“You—“

Delphine pointed at the ‘Notes’ section. ‘Make it personal.’

“That’s— They— They could _kill_ you, they _will_ kill you, why would you hire—“

“I will get what I want, or they will kill me. Either way works fine for me.”

Leanne was unsure how to respond. This woman had taken out a contract against _herself_; what could possibly—

Delphine’s eyes hardened. She lifted the knife. Took a step towards Leanne.

“The same applies to you.”
