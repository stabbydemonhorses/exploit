# Chapter 2: Dressara
Leanne restrained herself from pacing. There was little room for it, anyway.

The room was constructed of cement walls meters thick, reinforced with something or other. It could probably withstand a runaway Exploit. It would certainly hold her ship, one wall over.

She shivered. Her small silvery tunic exposed more skin to the elements than she would like, but should be similar enough to what the servants at the party were wearing for the Dressarans not to notice.

The room beeped. Leanne’s hand dropped to her side, then relaxed.

She pulled a card from beneath her tunic and inserted it into a slot in the wall.

The room beeped again. The wall ejected the card. Leanne felt herself tense.

It ought to have worked. Bounty cards remained valid so long as the bodies of their targets were never found, and this body wouldn’t be. 

In fact, it had just worked a few minutes previously to get her from the hanger into the holding room, and it had worked a few minutes before that to get her authorization to land in the hanger to begin with.

Leanne looked at the card again. Her muscles tightened— it was the Leesomes’ card, marking ‘Elsa’ for assassination. Assassination wasn’t quite legal. Thankfully, the machine hadn’t seemed to have noticed.

She shoved it back beneath her tunic, and fished out the right card: a bounty for a Dressaran man whose body had never been turned in for its reward.

The room beeped again, but less harshly. The door slid open.

She descended the stairs, taking extra care with the last one—it was never aligned right.

As soon as her feet were on the grass, the mobile hanger lifted itself back into the sky, its gravity engines humming quietly beneath the light Dressaran wind. More traditional propulsion would have damaged the grass, Leanne supposed. 

She guessed the mobile hangers were tested enough and automated enough to be allowed the immense amount of energy required to power their engines. They probably consumed easily a crate of energy cells weekly—a quantity of energy no human was generally trusted with.

It was late. Seven was already setting. The sun wouldn’t be far behind.

The trip down had taken longer than she had anticipated. The traffic must have been chaotic. It was likely due to Seven’s still-in-progress orbit change. 

The change should’ve been done a week ago. There had been issues, apparently. The missing shipments of energy cells likely hadn’t helped.

Leanne had only stolen half of them. She had been hired to destroy them, but ultimately, what was the difference?

----

The women of Dressara often wore dresses, which Leanne both admired and found a shame. Leanne enjoyed wearing dresses, but found women in suits much more handsome.

Delphine was nothing if not handsome. She was tall, and did her best to look so: her fine Elisian suit lengthened her body, and she had paired it, rather than with pants, with a skirt just long enough to wave gently in the light breeze the Dressarans were so fond of.

Dressara was the larger of Seven’s two moons. It was pleasant enough if you liked their sort of pomp, unlike Seven itself, which was quite dour.

The moon was inhabited only by a few thousand people, plus each of their few thousand servants. There was a party nearly daily, and everyone was invited—sometimes the servants, too. The men, Leanne knew, did little more than stand about all day, whether at parties or at home. The women, Leanne assumed, did something more than simply wear their dresses and stroll about—even the wealthy had to bring in more money somehow—but whatever they did, it was never interesting enough for Leanne to learn what it was.

But if any Dressaran woman—or, for that matter, any Dressaran at all—were ever to do anything remotely interesting, Leanne would bet it would be Delphine.

Delphine was the target, Leanne assumed. She looked different now, of course. On the Leesomes’ card, her name hadn’t been Delphine. Her face had been soft, now it was angular; her hair long and red, now short and black. But there was no mistaking her.

She’d probably only changed face once. Faces records could only be unsealed with a half-dozen odd warrants, but Leanne hadn’t needed the records: while she didn’t think she was all that great at tracking people through their identity changes, she had to acknowledge she was better at it than any of her peers. She often hardly needed to research. It was generally easy enough to guess what people would do with their new identities.

Leanne had guessed that a Dressaran woman like Delphine wouldn’t miss out on the lavish parties her relations so often threw, even if she would now have to attend as a guest in order not to be associated with whatever scandals lay in her past.

It was unlikely Leanne would learn much from this excursion. Delphine was Dressaran, after all, and almost certainly knew nothing of use. Still, if Leanne was lucky, she could learn something useful, and maybe she’d have some fun, too— not necessarily in that order. And if nothing else, she could at least do the job and collect the rather substantial reward.

Leanne looked away. Delphine was approaching. Leanne’s neck muscles tensed, back straightened, eyes glanced down—

She jumped as a hand tapped her bare shoulder.

“My apologies,” said Delphine’s deep, melodic voice. “I didn’t mean to startle you.”

Leanne tore her eyes away from Delphine’s lips—halfway between smile and smirk, just as she had seen before, and there was no mistaking the lipstick—up to Delphine’s eyes, kind and stalwart, framed by her short black hair.

“A red,” Delphine instructed. “Syrah. From Earth, not the Lyonan nonsense.”

Leanne nodded readily. Her heart beat unevenly as she felt herself move towards the far end of the garden where the bar was.

She had considered inviting herself to the garden party. The security at Dressaran parties was laughable. They tended to assume they were safe at all times. If they didn’t recognize her, they’d assume their Alt was forgetful. They’d make smalltalk just fine, and be friendly enough.

But while Dressarans rarely had much of substance to say, when they did, they generally only shared it with those they knew well. Even those that recognized Leanne from her previous intrusions would not feel so comfortable around her. Servants, however, were generally invisible.

Leanne shivered as she poured the wine. The artificial wind tickled the scar upon her shoulder, the scar Delphine had tapped, the scar Leanne had received on the moon Delphinia after thirty seven assassins had cornered her.

She assumed Delphine was named after Delphinia. As much as Dressarans looked down upon the other planets and moons, they frequently named their children after them: “Delphine,” “Lyon,” “Tria,” “Elsa.”

“Ma’am,” said Leanne, eyes downcast, as she handed Delphine her glass of wine. Delphine was on the outskirts of the party, observing from a paved path near one of the rear doors of the house—Leanne forgot whose. She guessed Delphine was wistful for a past she could never fully rejoin. Then again, if Dressara were _her_ past, Leanne wouldn’t want to rejoin it.

Delphine took the glass, her fingers winding about it delicately, her deep red fingernails clicking gently against it.

She looked at Leanne. Glanced her up and down. The corner of her lips turned up a bit further.

“You look stunning, obviously,” Leanne heard herself say.

A soft chuckle escaped Delphine. “Obviously,” she agreed. “Not that you’ve done poorly for yourself.”

“I’m not different from the others,” said Leanne, nodding her head towards the other servants, who were busy attending a loud crowd of primping Dressaran men.

Delphine glanced at them, and back at Leanne. “I don’t think so.” Her smirk faded a bit as she glanced at the wine in her hand. “Not that there’s anything wrong with them. They’re just…”

Her eyes hardened and turned back to Leanne. “Not you.”

Leanne’s breath wanted to catch. “Not me, no.”

“Then who are you?” asked Delphine, closing the distance between them. “Why come here as a servant? They wouldn’t know the difference if you came as Queen of Dressara.”

Leanne thought that might be a bit of a stretch. Dressara had never had a queen. Neither had any planet in Q729, although Leanne supposed that could change if the secessionists’ futile dreams ever came true.

“You knew the difference,” said Leanne.

“I’m not from Dressara,” said Delphine.

“Yes, you are,” said Leanne.

Delphine’s smirk returned. “So, you’re here for me?”

Leanne had faced many larger and taller than even Delphine, but something about her made Leanne’s chest tighten and her breath quiver.

“So to speak,” said Leanne. She looked to the side. Tried to count what she saw: two stones in the grass; a tree; three branches; yellow lights of the party, glittering in Delphine’s brown eyes—

“Well, introduce yourself,” said Delphine.

Leanne took a breath. Straightened her back. Looked up into those sparkling eyes.

“Leanne,” she said.

What else could she say? Leanne didn’t know where she was from. She could hardly say what she did. ‘Assassin?’ ‘Pilot?’ ‘Bounty hunter,’ perhaps—it would at least be legal, and sometimes it would even be the truth.

“And you know me,” said Delphine, bringing the wine up between them and taking a long, deliberate sip.

“I know you’re from Dressara,” said Leanne. It had been on the card. Delphine was Dressaran, and there oughtn’t be a thing interesting about her.

“My _parents_ were from Dressara,” said Delphine. She glanced down at her drink, her brow furrowing just slightly. Then, back to Leanne.

Leanne raised an eyebrow. Took a small step forward. Tentatively pushed Delphine against the mahogany door of the house. It must’ve been imported from Earth; the door alone must be worth—

“And you?” Leanne asked.

“Somewhere else,” said Delphine, leaning away from Leanne, her head tilted slightly back, her voice almost lost in the noise of the party, a small smile tugging not quite reluctantly at her lips.

“That’s not what I’ve read,” said Leanne, placing her palms against the door either side of Delphine, leaning over her yet still looking up into her eyes. She pulled the card from beneath her tunic—the right one, the Leesomes’—not breaking her gaze.

The corner of Delphine’s lips tugged upwards again. Leanne thought she caught a brief glimpse of surprise flash across Delphine’s face as she glanced at the card, but it had been hard to be certain: Leanne’s lungs had again tightened, and—

Delphine brought the wine up to her lips once again, snaking her arm around Leanne’s.

“Hardly looks like me,” she said. “Perhaps you have me mistaken.”

“There’s no mistaking you, I’m sure,” said Leanne. “Even if you have changed name and face.”

Delphine smiled, almost with a hint of wistfulness, and Leanne felt herself taken aback. She knew people generally changed face to erase past scandals, but for some reason, she was always surprised at their fondness for how others previously knew them.

“Well then,” said Delphine, “what else do you think you know about me?”

Delphine pulled herself away from the wall, standing to her full height. Leanne met her gaze—Delphine was easily a foot taller—and forced herself not to flinch away.

“I know what your parents named you,” said Leanne. Assuming, once more, that the information from the card had been accurate.

Delphine shrugged her shoulders. She glanced away—smugly, Leanne thought. Her suit lifted up. Her shirt was untucked, the dark skin beneath it was—

“So do I,” said Delphine. “Hardly makes you special.”

“And what if I’m here to kill you?” asked Leanne, reaching a hand down to the hem of her tunic, where, for all Delphine knew, she could have a knife (in fact she had a small collection, but generally she needed only one).

“Strangers always are,” said Delphine, meeting Leanne’s stare once more. “Still not special.”

“And what if I wasn’t?” asked Leanne. “What if…”

Her heart banged against her chest. Fuck, interrogate, or kill? Perhaps all three, perhaps in that order, and perhaps it didn’t matter, and perhaps she didn’t care.

She collected all the pride she could find as the party’s music swelled. Held out a hand. Looked again into Delphine’s eyes.

“What if all I want, for the moment, is a dance?” asked Leanne, forcing the words out smoothly, struggling not to look away.

“Me, dance with a servant?” asked Delphine. “A Dressaran would never lower herself.”

“You’re not Dressaran,” said Leanne.

Delphine’s smile twitched. Leanne felt herself smile in return, and felt boldness rush into her chest.

“If all I, a stranger, want for the evening… is to dance with a woman as obviously stunning as yourself… Would I be special then?”

Delphine’s smirk unfolded into a small, sweet smile. Her hand grabbed Leanne’s.

“Perhaps.”

----

Seven rose just as it had set: early. Its dim light shone through the open shutters. Even with Dressara’s longer cycle, Leanne was certain she had not slept enough. Some of that was undoubtedly her own fault, and some of it was certainly Delphine’s, in whose arms and sheets she was still tangled.

Delphine was snoring just audibly, and Leanne couldn’t suppress a little smile. 

The room was smaller than Leanne would have expected: just enough room for the large bed and its small nightstands, which Leanne assumed were imported. 

What woke her? It was hard to tell. She didn’t usually wake until fully rested, but she also didn’t usually share a bed.

Her head turned abruptly to the window. It was a clear dawn sky, smoothly gray with hints of purple and green. 

Her eyes scanned the walls, over to the door. Closed.

The air was crisp and fresh, as Dressaran morning air always was. There was a tiny smell of berries. The kitchen was likely preparing breakfast. Perhaps they’d have it in bed—

A snap from outside— but it was a squirrel.

The squirrel peeked in through the windows and tilted its head, a nut held between its paws.

It skittered off.

Leanne’s hand twitched. Her eyes glanced to the floor. Her collection of knives lay amongst the piles of clothing. 

Delphine had also had a knife. Leanne’s eyes drifted to the cabinet. Delphine had insisted on locking it away proper. Leanne suspected the blade was poisoned.

The cabinet was closed.
