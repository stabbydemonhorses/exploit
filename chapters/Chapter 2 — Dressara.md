The women of Dressara often wore dresses, which Leanne both admired and found a shame. Leanne enjoyed wearing dresses, but found women in suits much more handsome.

Leanne assumed the women of Dressara did something more than simply wear dresses and stroll about, but if they did, she never learned what it was. The men, she knew, did nothing more than stand about. They usually wore suits, and they were utterly boring, both as people and as targets. 

Dressara was a somewhat pleasant place, if you enjoyed their sort of pomp, much unlike the rather dour planet Seven, around which Dressara held a lazy orbit. Like anywhere else, however, it was rather difficult to land on illegally.

The outer defenses only detected incoming entities of high energy—whether of high mass or high velocity. Approaching at any sane speed would avoid triggering them.

The inner defenses, however, were far more formidable. They could detect the approach of anything electric, even something as small as a reading lamp. If the reading lamp wasn’t cleared to land, they’d blow it out of the sky.

It was simpler to land legally.

Most assassins occasionally worked within the realm of the law. Even if they didn’t like it to be widely known, some jobs were contracted by the government. These were usually accompanied by warrants.

The assassins did not require identification: their Alts wouldn’t help identify them if their mission was to kill someone, even if it were entirely legal to do so. Instead, the warrants themselves, paired with the card from the arranger, were sufficient identification.

Forging a warrant was nearly impossible. But Leanne didn’t need to. She already had a stockpile. Warrants for assassination didn’t expire unless revoked, and so long as the people the warrants were for didn’t show up dead, the warrants were still valid. Leanne made sure the subjects of the warrants in her stockpile never showed up.

Leanne wasn’t sure exactly what the warrant transmitted to the ground, but it had been enough to give her clearance to land. It had been for a particularly boring target from a few years back. She had found him within minutes of her arrival. She didn’t remember what she did with his body. It didn’t matter.

She glanced at the card she had stolen from her attackers’ ship. The target was named “Delphine,” probably after the moon Delphinia. As much as Dressarans looked down upon the other planets and moons, they frequently named them: “Delphine,” “Delphy,” “Elsa,” “Elise,” and so on.

Leanne compared it to the woman leaning against the column ahead. She looked different, now, of course. Her face had been angular, now it was soft. Her hair black, now red. But there was no mistaking her taste for dark lipstick, her smile, and her style.

She hadn’t been hard to track down. She’d only changed Face once, and although Faces records were sealed, Leanne’s specialty was guessing what people would do after changing their identities. A Dressaran woman like this wouldn’t miss out on the lavish parties her relations threw, even if she would now have to attend as a guest in order not to be associated with her former self and scandals.
