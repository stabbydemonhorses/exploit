She woke, again to violence, again with scalpel in hand, again already coated with the blood of those who would kill her. Across the room, the woman, tall, handsome, wearing the finest of suits, looked away—

She woke, again to violence, again holding something—not a knife, but the griprail beside her bed, wet with her own blood, her grip threatening to give way.

She let go. The floors, walls, ceilings slammed against her. There never was much difference between them, all the same utilitarian grates, all tarnished by bloodstains she never bothered to fully scrub out. She grabbed another griprail, closer to the doorway, closer to the cockpit.

Leanne was a pilot. Unfortunately, people did not pay her to fly spaceships. They paid her to kill others, and they paid others to kill her. 

The griprail tore at her, yanking fiercely at her elbow, forcing a grimace. Her muscles strained to pull her up. Her other arm reached for the next handle. Her feet swung wildly for purchase, but couldn’t quite reach the rails.

She needed to start the engines. But Leanne didn’t have an Alt. She couldn’t just _think_ at it and have it control the ship for her. Leanne had been missing hers from her earliest memory, three years back, when she had woken holding that knife, dead bodies strewn about her. It was possible Leanne had an Alt and it didn’t talk to her. But even if she couldn’t find any scars on her head to prove it, Leanne suspected hers had been removed. It would explain the memory loss.

Without an Alt, Leanne’d have to get to the cockpit herself. But with how fast the ship was spinning, sideways was up, the cockpit was a climb, and she was twice as heavy as she ought to be. She was bleeding, she wasn’t sure from where. Her arms were begging her to let go. It would be quick, or quick enough: she’d break her neck, or whoever was after her this time would shoot her. But her hand reached, and it found the next rung, and it pulled her up.

They must have rammed her ship. They had probably hit her ship’s gravity field generators, or else they were using their own to interfere with hers. They’d let her spin for a minute more, maybe two, and then steady the ship so they could walk in and blow away what was left of her. They’d need the ship steady to enter: it was unlikely they had portable field generators to steady themselves, and even if they did, nearly all portable generators required Alts to operate, and Alts refused to help their humans hurt other humans.

Leanne turned just in time to see a crate of batteries break free of its bindings and careen towards her. She swung her feet up, just under her screaming hands. She let go, and pushed against the wall as hard as she could. Her fingers almost broke as they grasped the rung on the other side of the doorway.

Small batteries spilled from the crate as it smashed against the wall. Leanne did her best to ignore them as they pummeled her. Her legs and arms strained as she climbed into the cockpit.

She reached for the _Engine Power_ switch. If she turned the engines on and managed to wrestle the controls, she could right the ship and get away. But Leanne could never get away. They were always after her, and they always would be. She could kill two today, and two more would take their place tomorrow. But if she let them live, they’d be back, and so would the two others, and so would more besides.

Leanne withdrew her hands. Three years ago, she had woken up in a Faces facility, bloody scalpel in hand, dead bodies scattered around her, disoriented and without memory. Naturally, she had stolen just about everything she could carry—which was quite a bit, particularly after she had stolen a cart.

The Faces facility had happened to be above a minor military storage office. There wasn’t much in the way of weapons, but there was a portable gravity field generator—a very unique portable gravity field generator that did not require an Alt to operate.

Leanne released the belt keeping her generator in its place
beneath the console. It leapt away, but her hand snapped out and grasped a strap. She hauled it up and flipped the switch.

The generator was very confused. It was meant to be worn, not held, and when she turned it on, it wasn’t sure which way was meant to be up. Instead of being pulled in all directions as her ship spun, Leanne was now being pulled towards the back corner of the cockpit, and now only with her normal weight. Conveniently, the back corner was exactly where she wanted to go.

She let go of the rail and fell, landing on the rear cockpit wall. She lifted her suit off the wall and scrambled to put it on. She glanced at the gauges on the console: the ship’s spin was beginning to slow.

Leanne pulled the helmet over her head. It drew her long brown hair in for her, and sealed itself onto the rest of her suit. She tightened the belt around her waist, double-checked the tools hanging on it, and hauled the generator onto her back.

She jumped from the wall to the floor, gravity re-situating itself about her as she moved. A light flashed on the console: her rear outer airlock doors were being forced open.

Leanne banged a hand against the field generator as she steadied herself with a griprail. It wasn’t working right. It should make everything steady. She shook her head of it and tapped a switch. The feed from the airlock camera came on screen.

Only one person was entering, heavily armed by the looks of him. Leanne was sure there was at least one more staying behind to man their ship’s controls: they’d be flying manually, as their Alts would not be helping them attack her.

Another blue light flashed; Leanne blinked its echoes from her eyes: the inner airlock doors were opening. Leanne flipped the _Engine Power_ switch, only allowing herself a moment’s pause to relish the roar of the engines engaging. 

It was a good, strong ship, even if simple: a sturdy outer hull wrapped around a cockpit, a bedroom, and a hold, nestled between four giant engines. She had, of course, stolen it. There had been a dozen ships docked at the Faces facility. Several had been larger. Many had been faster. This one had been hers.

She slammed half the throttles to full forward thrust; the other half to full reverse. She tumbled as the gravity field struggled to find its bearings.

Something wet was pooling at the bottom of her helmet’s goggles. Right: she was bleeding. It must be a head wound. She needed to handle this quick.

With the gravity field she should be good to run, but she kept her pace steady as she moved through her bedroom to the door of the hold, carefully ducking under the flying crate and batteries.

Her hand reached for her gun as she opened the door, but there was no need. Her attacker was tumbling. His neck wasn’t broken yet: he was still managing to bring his arms long up in time to protect himself, but he was tiring embarrassingly quickly. A few of his many weapons had detached themselves from him and were now flying around the hold with him.

The hold door resealed itself behind Leanne. She must’ve flicked the switch out of habit—it was a good habit when on a spaceship.

She’d closed it just in time. The forces of the spinning ships were far too much for their docking connectors to handle, and they wrenched themselves apart.

Her attacker had left the airlocks open in case he had needed a quick escape. His escape was rather quicker than he intended: the air from the hold forced its way out, shoving him into space.

Leanne was not far behind: her gravity generator tried to keep her on the floor; her fingers brushed the griprail; it was not enough. 

Later, she’d tell herself she intended it this way all along. She’d put the suit on, after all.

Had she not been wearing the generator, Leanne assumed she’d be spinning fast. Instead, she was floating calmly through the apparent emptiness, breathing fresh oxygen from the tanks on her back.

Her ship was in a desperate spin. The engines had stopped: the ship was just smart enough to detect it was spinning, but not quite smart enough to stop the spin. She’d figure out how to stop it later.

The other ship was twice as large as hers. It looked patched together from pieces of other ships, but Leanne was rather certain it had been designed that way: it had been the style in the 2870’s, and was still popular amongst some. Its seven side engines seemed rather weak; Leanne supposed most of the power was reserved for the rear engines. She looked away as they flashed bright green. 

Leanne guessed their Alts were helping them to dexterously take the ship out of its spin, now that they were trying to get away. 

She glanced to her left. She wasn’t sure if they’d come back for their partner. But she had a rule. She had to.

She raised her gun. The man who had boarded her ship wasn’t that far away. They had been blown out more or less together. 

He saw her gun. He waved his hands, tried to wriggle away. His hands scraped at the nothingness— then stopped. The bullet pierced his heart. Frothy blood flowed into the vacuum, boiling and freezing.

Leanne’s eyes returned to the hodgepodge of a ship that had attacked hers. Its spin had stopped. Its engines were only now about to fire. Their Alts were definitely flying it—only Alts were so thorough. Humans would have left already, checklists be damned.

Leanne brought her feet up and nudged the field generator. It pulled her towards the other ship, even as it began to accelerate.

She landed on its hull. Her knees buckled and her head spun. The landing had been a bit harder than she had intended.

The cockpit wasn’t too far. One foot, then the other, she moved. She blinked her eyes, but it didn’t quite bring the brightness back. There wasn’t much to steady herself with. She could taste the blood on her lips. She took deep breaths. She’d be fine. Each breath was fresh from her tanks, rich in oxygen.

Leanne took an explosive from her belt, and planted it on the hull, just behind the cockpit windows. The windows would be the strongest part; the joints holding them the weakest. 

She stepped back. Entered a code on her wrist. It seemed low tech, but that was the way with most weapons. More advanced technology could only be controlled by Alts.

The explosion ripped the front of the cockpit off her attackers’ still-accelerating ship. Leanne hit the hull just before the debris shot over her.

Leanne’s other attacker flew out of the hole. A bullet followed her. Leanne supposed it hadn’t been necessary: the other attacker wasn’t wearing a suit. She’d be out in thirty seconds, and dead in another thirty, unless her Alt could pull off a miracle. But Leanne’s rule was Leanne’s rule.

Leanne forced herself to watch until the end. Her aim hadn’t been perfect. She’d hit the woman’s neck instead of her head.

The woman’s twitching slowed. The fury in her boiling eyes dimmed. 

Leanne took a deep breath, and crawled into her attacker’s ship. Her head spun as she landed in the remains of the cockpit. 

She checked the feeds from the cameras. It appeared she was alone, or alone enough. She rifled through the console. Her attackers, like her, were assassins. They should have a card for the job. It would have all the pertinent details, and they’d turn it in with proof of death. 

It was unlikely there’d be anything on the card to trace back to the submitter; assassins always worked through an Arranger, and even the Arranger rarely knew who hired them. But Leanne searched all the same, whether out of habit or hunch.

The card was small. There was a little yellow insignia on the upper-left of a diving eagle—the Leesome Arrangers, if Leanne remembered correctly. There was little information on it, besides a picture of her and her ship, and a location she once frequented years ago. It was extremely impressive that they found her at all. 

There was another card. Same insignia. It was odd: Arrangers usually only handed out one card at a time to any given assassin. Leanne always assumed it was because the cards themselves were expensive due to their cryptographic something or others. 

On the second card was a woman. She lived on Dressara. Short black hair, angular face, and according to the card, not all that dangerous.

Could be important. Perhaps there was a link between this woman and Leanne. Or perhaps she was just another job, handed out at the same time. There were two attackers, after all; perhaps the Leesomes had given them each their own job.

Leanne pocketed the card. She looked out the window. Her ship was a speck in the distance. She glanced around the remains of the cockpit. It looked like it could still be flyable. 

She flicked the switches. Pulled the handles. The ship’s many engines weren’t meant to be controlled by a human, but she was managing to bring it around rather gracefully.

In the distance, she could see her ship, still spinning. Inside was probably a mess by now. She’d clean it up eventually.

The distance closed. She shook her head as she accelerated, and did precisely what her attackers had done before: she rammed her own ship.

The force broke her ship from its spin. It flew away, still spinning, if lightly.

Leanne jumped. She swung her legs up, as if doing a backflip, and aimed herself at her ship. 

She should have fallen on her head, but instead, gravity rearranged itself around her. It pulled her out of the damaged mashed-together ship, through the nothingness, home.
