She woke, again to violence, again with scalpel in hand, again already coated with the blood of those who would kill her. Across the room, the woman, tall, handsome, wearing the finest of suits, looked away—

She woke, again to violence, again holding something—not a knife, but the griprail beside her bed, wet with her own blood, her grip threatening to give way.

She let go. The floors, walls, ceilings slammed against her. There never was much difference between them, all the same utilitarian grates, all tarnished by bloodstains she never bothered to fully scrub out. She grabbed another griprail, closer to the doorway, closer to the cockpit.

Leanne was a pilot. Unfortunately, people did not pay her to fly spaceships. They paid her to kill others, and they paid others to kill her. 

The griprail tore at her, yanking fiercely at her elbow, forcing a grimace. Her muscles strained to pull her up. Her other arm reached for the next handle. Her feet swung wildly for purchase, but couldn’t quite reach the rails.

She needed to start the engines. But Leanne didn’t have an Alt. She couldn’t just _think_ at it and have it control the ship for her. Leanne had been missing hers from her earliest memory, three years back, when she had woken holding that knife, dead bodies strewn about her. It was possible Leanne had an Alt and it didn’t talk to her. But even if she couldn’t find any scars on her head to prove it, Leanne suspected hers had been removed. It would explain the memory loss.

Without an Alt, Leanne’d have to get to the cockpit herself. But with how fast the ship was spinning, sideways was up, the cockpit was a climb, and she was twice as heavy as she ought to be. She was bleeding, she wasn’t sure from where. Her arms were begging her to let go. It would be quick, or quick enough: she’d break her neck, or whoever was after her this time would shoot her. But her hand reached, and it found the next rung, and it pulled her up.

They must have rammed her ship. They had probably hit her ship’s gravity field generators, or else they were using their own to interfere with hers. They’d let her spin for a minute more, maybe two, and then steady the ship so they could walk in and blow away what was left of her. They’d need the ship steady to enter: it was unlikely they had portable field generators to steady themselves, and even if they did, nearly all portable generators required Alts to operate, and Alts refused to help their humans hurt other humans.

Leanne turned just in time to see a crate of batteries break free of its bindings and careen towards her. She swung her feet up, just under her screaming hands. She let go, and pushed against the wall as hard as she could. Her fingers almost broke as they grasped the rung on the other side of the doorway.

Small batteries spilled from the crate as it smashed against the wall. Leanne did her best to ignore them as they pummeled her. Her legs and arms strained as she climbed into the cockpit.

She reached for the _Engine Power_ switch. If she turned the engines on and managed to wrestle the controls, she could right the ship and get away. But Leanne could never get away: they were always after her, and they always would be. There were at least two after her today, and there’d be at least two more tomorrow, and two more after that. 

“No reprieve,” she muttered. It was necessary. Getting away was not sufficient. Thirty seven of them had to corner her on Delphinia before she could admit it to herself: they could survive, or she could. They did not survive.

Leanne withdrew her hands from the _Engine Power_ switch. Instead, she reached up under the console for the heavy, boxy backpack of a machine that was strapped underneath.

Three years ago, she had woken up in a Faces facility, bloody scalpel in hand, dead bodies scattered around her, disoriented and without memory. Naturally, she had stolen just about everything she could carry—which was quite a bit, particularly after she had stolen a cart.

The Faces facility had happened to be above a minor military storage office. There wasn’t much in the way of weapons, but there was a portable gravity field generator—a very unique portable gravity field generator that did not require an Alt to operate.

Leanne released the belt keeping her generator in its place beneath the console. It leapt away, but her hand snapped out and grasped a strap. She hauled it up and flipped the switch.

The generator was very confused. It was meant to be worn, not held, and when she turned it on, it wasn’t sure which way was meant to be up. Instead of being pulled in all directions as her ship spun, Leanne was now being pulled towards the back corner of the cockpit, and now only with her normal weight. Conveniently, the back corner was exactly where she wanted to go.
She let go of the rail and fell, landing on the rear cockpit wall. She lifted her suit off the wall and scrambled to put it on. She glanced at the gauges on the console: the ship’s spin was beginning to slow.

Leanne pulled the helmet over her head. It drew her long brown hair in for her, and sealed itself onto the rest of her suit. She tightened the belt around her waist, double-checked the tools hanging on it, and hauled the generator onto her back.

She jumped from the wall to the floor, gravity re-situating itself about her as she moved. A light flashed on the console: her rear outer airlock doors were being forced open.

Leanne banged a hand against the field generator as she steadied herself with a griprail. It wasn’t working right. It should make everything steady. She shook her head of it and tapped a switch. The feed from the airlock camera came on screen.

Only one person was entering, heavily armed by the looks of him. Leanne was sure there was at least one more staying behind to man their ship’s controls: they’d be flying manually, as their Alts would not be helping them attack her.

Another light flashed; Leanne blinked its echoes from her eyes: the inner airlock doors were opening. Leanne flipped the _Engine Power_ switch, only allowing herself a moment’s pause to relish the roar of the engines engaging. 

It was a good, strong ship, even if simple: a sturdy outer hull wrapped around a cockpit, a bedroom, and a hold, nestled between four giant engines. She had, of course, stolen it. There had been a dozen ships docked at the Faces facility. Several had been larger. Many had been faster. This one had been hers.

She slammed half the throttles to full forward thrust; the other half to full reverse. She tumbled as the gravity field struggled to find its bearings.

Something wet was pooling at the bottom of her helmet’s goggles. Right: she was bleeding. It must be a head wound. She needed to handle this quick.

With the gravity field she should be good to run, but she kept her pace steady as she moved through her bedroom to the door of the hold, carefully ducking under the flying crate and batteries.

Her hand reached for her gun as she opened the door, but there was no need. Her attacker was tumbling. His neck wasn’t broken yet: he was still managing to bring his arms up in time to protect himself, but he was tiring embarrassingly quickly. A few of his many weapons had detached themselves from him and were now flying around the hold with him.

The hold door resealed itself behind Leanne. She must’ve flicked the switch out of habit—it was a good habit when on a spaceship.

She’d closed it just in time. The forces of the spinning ships were far too much for their docking connectors to handle, and they wrenched themselves apart.

Her attacker had left the airlocks open in case he had needed a quick escape. His escape was rather quicker than he intended: the air from the hold forced its way out, shoving him into space.

Re: assassin flying out of airlock, and her after him:

Later, she’d tell herself she intended it this way all along. But she more preferred the simpler, direct approach. Long-term gambles rarely paid.
