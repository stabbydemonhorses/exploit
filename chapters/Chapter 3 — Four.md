# Chapter 3
“What _do_ you want?” asked Leanne. She refused to back away from Delphine, even as she advanced with poisoned blade in hand.

“Four.”

Leanne blinked. An old itch reawakened. Her fingers stretched slightly, a slight tingle running down them from her elbow.

“Four?” she asked, holding her face steady.

“I was there when it went awry,” said Delphine. “And my parents.”

The tip of her knife approached Leanne’s chin. Leanne did not move her eyes from Delphine’s.

“Were _you_?” demanded Delphine.

“Unlikely,” said Leanne. She had wondered the same. 

Leanne had woken surrounded by bodies, scalpel in hand, scant months after Four’s Exploit had gone awry, with no traces that she had been anywhere else.

Delphine raised an eyebrow. “Unlikely?” she probed.

“I hardly share my life story with just anyone, short as it may be,” said Leanne.

“Now I’m anyone?”

“You _are_ holding me at knifepoint,” said Leanne, her brow creasing just perceptibly. “Rather common, in my experience.”

“And you aren’t talking,” said Delphine, her voice hard but her knife lowering slightly.

Leanne’s hands snapped up: one grabbed Delphine’s wrist, forcing her hand open; the knife fell into Leanne’s other waiting hand. She tossed it aside.

Delphine glanced at it as it hit the bed with a small thump; was she concerned? Delphine was still hard for Leanne to read. Leanne supposed the knife could be as antique as many of Delphine’s other possessions, but she didn’t much care.

“Your parents died in the Exploit?” asked Leanne.

“No,” said Delphine. “Why is it ‘unlikely’ you were there?”

“If I was, I ought to have had larger traces of the heavier elements the Exploit produced,” said Leanne. 

The Exploit wasn’t generally supposed to produce matter, but it had not been properly contained. It was highly fortunate there was still a planet Four at all. 

For that matter, it was lucky there was still a Q729 system. Wrangling with full trillionths of a supernova’s energy was not without risks, even with the many precautions; the highly charged Dust between Two and Four was evidence enough of that, as was the field of rocks between Four and Seven.

“What are you trying to learn?” asked Leanne. “What do you think he would have told you? What do you think _I_ could possibly tell you?”

“The most probable model suggests a team of five to seven assassins were on Four at the time, possibly contracted through the Rosens,” said Delphine. “Given the Rosens’ estimated rate of attrition and the probable skill of the assassins, the chances of them sending one after me for a ‘personal’ kill is seven in eight. The chance of my death is… acceptable.”

“Acceptable?” asked Leanne. “Yes, we’re at a severe disadvantage for personal kills, but they’d be sending their best; they should be more than capable of outmaneuvering an Alt—“

“I am a reasonably practiced fighter. With the assistance of my Alt, my chance of death is approximately one in two,” said Delphine. “Acceptable.”

Her numbers were plausible. Her Alt had done its homework. Or, perhaps, she had. Leanne wasn’t sure if the Alt would have considered helping with the math to be helping with the violence Delphine had clearly been planning.

“I did not ask about traces of elements in your body,” said Delphine. She grabbed her shirt with her toes, and lifted it from the floor. “You could have switched Face. The only traces would be in your brain.”

Leanne nodded slightly. It was plausible, but if it had been done, it had been done well with minimal scarring.

“I _asked_ if you were _there_, Leanne,” said Delphine, buttoning up her shirt. 

She closed the distance. Her eyes searched Leanne’s; her hand reached up, but did not touch Leanne’s face. Her still-unbuttoned shirt lightly brushed Leanne’s breasts, before pulling back slightly— 

“Were you?” asked Delphine. “Or, don’t you know?”

Delphine did not seem to struggle to read Leanne, her gaze unwavering as her hands deftly buttoned up her shirt, occasionally brushing gently across Leanne’s chest.

“Just how far back can you remember?” asked Delphine.

“Three years,” said Leanne.

“Earthen years?” asked Delphine, like a secessionist. Leanne shot Delphine a dirty look, and Delphine chuckled.

“How long after Four?” she pressed. She looked down at the floor; her eyes darted from her own underwear to Leanne’s.

“Three months,” said Leanne. “Earthen months,” she added, rather mockingly. 

Delphine rolled her eyes. She smirked slightly. Picked up Leanne’s underwear; tossed them out the window. Leanne’s nose scrunched up. _Really, Delphine?_ 

“If your parents didn’t die in the Exploit,” asked Leanne—_focus—_ “Might I ask… What happened to them?”

“They died just before,” said Delphine. “Killed. They were Exploit engineers.”

Of course they were. Four wouldn’t have been inhabited by anyone but Exploit engineers and their families until its Exploit was operational.

“My mother worked as a Primary Containment Engineer,” Delphine continued, pulling on her own underwear & skirt. Leanne felt, suddenly, very underdressed. “My father usually worked on the other side of Four in Secondary Acceleration, but was visiting my mother for lunch.”

“Siblings?” asked Leanne.

“Sister. Gone.”

Leanne didn’t think Delphine wanted her to pry any further. She tentatively reached out an arm and snaked it around Delphine’s shoulder. Her shirt and skirt were both rougher than Leanne would have expected…

“You thought you might’ve been there,” said Delphine, letting her own arm wrap around Leanne’s waist. 

“Yes,” said Leanne. It was, indeed, why she had checked herself for traces of the heavier elements.

“You still might’ve been,” said Delphine. “There was evidence of a fight. Perhaps you lost.”

It was possible. Twice now, it would seem, she’d been targeted by someone also contracted to kill Delphine. A connection was seeming more and more likely. If there were some connection between them, the events on Four would be likely candidate.

Delphine stood abruptly, her eyes narrowing. Leanne’s arm fell to the bed.

She strode towards the door; her hand reached out before her—

“Delphine?” asked Leanne.

“There’s no…” Delphine’s hand reached the knob, but did not turn it. “Hasn’t yours noticed?”

“My… My Alt?” asked Leanne.

“There’s nobody,” said Delphine. “Nobody out there. Is it…” She tapped the side of her head. Her other hand, still on the doorknob, twitched. “Yours hasn’t noticed?”

“I don’t have one,” said Leanne. She stood. The hairs on her arms stood on end in the now somehow less pleasant cool morning air.

Consternation briefly flashed upon Delphine’s face; her hand twitched again. Gripped the doorknob. Turned—

The door swung inwards.

Blood.

It trailed along the white marble floors; up the off-white walls; up on the ceiling in little splatters.

Delphine breathed in sharply. She stood rigid, silhouetted within the bright sunlight streaming through the hall.

Leanne grabbed a knife—her sharpest—from the pile on the floor. Walked up to Delphine. Peered through the door.

The hallway was still.

A man in a tuxedo—one of the servants, Leanne thought—stood against a wall, leaning just so. A stream of blood, not yet dry, ran down his neck to the floor.

His eyes were open. His mouth was shut and still, nearly peaceful.

Down the hall, upon a bench up against a window, were seated two more tuxedoed servants: one man, one woman, each with a hole through their forehead—an exit hole, Leanne caught herself thinking, swallowing nothingness.

Delphine realized the same: her eyes drifted to the window—probably where the killer had entered.

“This is wrong,” said Leanne.

Delphine did not reply. Her eyes continued down the hall to the door at the far end, guarded by two women. Their arms were at their sides; their heads tilted oddly. What had happened to them was not immediately obvious.

“Elsar does accidents, not this,” Leanne continued. “This is…”

“Personal?” asked Delphine. Her lip curled.

Leanne didn’t think so. This was more a _statement_ than anything else.

She shook herself slightly. Very little phased her, but something about this—

Leanne’s head spun. A door, only just open; was it to the kitchen? Leanne knew she should have studied the house’s layout more thoroughly, but she had been distracted.

A crack of light shone through, the sounds of little drips with it. Ticks? Tiny noises, just barely there… 

Leanne moved towards the door. She heard Delphine turn and walk away, so slowly—back to her bedroom?—but something about the kitchen…

The door was heavy. It creaked open. Not so odd for an imported old Earthen door.

The wooden floor was marred with blood, scuffed around in messy streaks, mixed in with what Leanne suspected was supposed to be the morning meal: various grains, a small puddle of milk next to its glass bottle, a smattering of flour, some egg.

A squirrel poked at it. Leanne supposed it, like the door, was an import from Earth. It was probably squirrel hunting season, there were so many about—

Tick. Tick. Tick.

Behind the counter lay one of the cooks—or, Leanne assumed she was a cook. Her white frock was stained with grease even more than it was stained with blood from the wound in her stomach.

She was unposed. Had there not been time? A glance at the window told Leanne nobody had left.

The knife near the cook’s hand was too narrow for a chef’s knife. Wrong leverage for chopping and slicing. Its rough iron handle was balanced just so, and it was stained red from daily polishing in blood.

It wasn’t Elsar’s. Rather, it was—

Corner. Beside the dishwasher. Knife through her chin and brain held in her own hand. _This_ knife was the chef’s. 

Eileen. Leanne guessed she’d passed maybe twenty minutes ago. 

Elsar’s work, probably. Couldn’t have Eileen interfering with _his_ job. Likely caught her by surprise as she did the chef.

The System was probably better without Eileen, Leanne thought, but she didn’t like thinking such things. Her mouth twisted in distaste.

Tick. Tick. Tick.

It was emanating from a box beside Eileen’s body.

It was not logical. Eileen wouldn’t have placed it—and if she had, she wouldn’t have bothered posing bodies. Elsar might’ve, but then he wouldn’t have bothered to use Delphine’s knife: it wouldn’t have mattered if things had appeared accidental if he was going to destroy the entire manor.

It was also a problem, since Leanne was uncertain how to defuse the device. Perhaps she could just unplug the wires from the explosives, but she wasn’t sure. The old stopwatch was ticking down steadily. 

Seven minutes left.

Leanne backed away. She muttered to herself angrily. An Alt would have no issue disabling it.

“Delphine!” she called.

She lifted Eileen’s knife from the floor, hiding a recoil from nobody as her hand met the sticky blood-stained handle.

Knife in each hand—one held backwards, one forwards, as was her way—she felt better, yet still unprotected. The breeze entering through the window reminded her of why.

She shivered. Not a piece of clothing on her, and the one article of clothing she had nearby hardly offered protection anyway.

And there was someone else around.
