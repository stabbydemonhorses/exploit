# Chapter 3 - Take 3
Wake up.

Leanne. Wake up.

You need to leave. Now.

Your eyes blink open. It’s not too bright out, yet. Seven’s just starting to rise. You can see its wintry blue hues shimmer through the dimmed glass of the window. Even with Dressara’s longer cycle, you’re sure you didn’t sleep nearly enough. Some of that was undoubtedly your fault, and some of it was certainly Delphine’s.

She’s not in bed. Don’t be surprised you didn’t wake. She wasn’t a threat to you. You needn’t have noticed.

You _do_ need to run. But you don’t.

You pull on the slip of a dress from last night. Strap on your knives. Your hand lingers on your new favorite… Really? Feeling _that_ sentimental, are you? There’ll be no use to your little giggly smile if you’re dead, Leanne.

Outside. Now. Use the window. It’s—

You glance at it. You leave through the door.

The hallways are quiet. Nobody aside from the kitchen staff should be awake yet, and they’d be in a different wing.

Don’t you wonder where Delphine is, Leanne? She went outside. That scent of dewy grass? It’s from a recently-opened door. The one at the end of the hall, perhaps?

You should follow her.

Finally. Through the door. Outside. Yes, Leanne, there were this many trees last night. The Dressarans like holding their parties amongst the little alcoves. Were you that inattentive last ni—

It doesn’t matter.

She’s wearing boots. You see the imprints over in the grass.

There’s no need for stealth, Leanne— fine. Hide behind the trees. Just move _quickly,_ will you?

Yes! You see her up ahead, darting from tree to tree.

It’s not worth trying to hide, Leanne. The silvery material of your dress is quite literally reflective. You need to run.

You’re not listening. You need to leave now! Fuck Delphine! No— no, not like that—

Fine. Run to her. Grab her. Forget stealth, this is—

You think this is like always. You get too close to someone and you panic. It’s different this time. There’s danger. Danger! You could _die_, Leanne.

You crouch down. Your legs protest mildly, but mercifully, you don’t slow your pace. Delphine must be nearly a quarter mile ahead of you.

She’s heading east. You don’t see anyone waiting for her.

Your eyebrows raise. She has a sword. It’s hanging from her waist, swaying as she moves.

She can’t be more than a few hundred feet away now. Call out, Leanne, call out and go—

Delphine stops. Stands tall behind a tree. Her hand rests upon the hilt of her sword.

Why are you stopping Leanne? You’re only a couple trees away. You could—

She should know you’re here, anyway. Her Alt should have told her; it would be surveilling the property’s security systems. Unless…

Delphine means to hurt someone. It would explain the sword. It would also explain why she’s bothering to peek around the tree.

There’s someone there.

It doesn’t matter, Leanne. Just grab her and go! Forget about anyone else. Let them chase you, they—

Delphine spins out of her cover, sword in hands, and swings.

You hear a yell.

Not hers.

A few seconds later, you hear voices. Delphine’s, and another.

You need to run, Leanne. Instead, you creep closer.

A man is on his knees. One hand grips a wrist. The other lies on the ground, a gun still held within it.

Behind him stands Delphine. Her sword rests upon his throat.

“I wasn’t there, I swear, I wasn’t, I wasn’t even a hunter yet, I—“

Your stomach turns. You know him. Albert. A hunter. He helped you once. Got a month’s food thanks to him, and a little cleverness. 

Albert knows she will kill him. He knows she won’t let him die until he’s told her everything.

He knows she doesn’t believe him.

But he’s not lying. You can see it on his face. In his eyes. It’s in the rhythm of the heartbeat, too, but you aren’t clever enough to tease that out of the cacophony of morning sounds.

And then he spots you.

His eyes widen. He recognizes you. He does not hope you will intervene. But…

“Her! I can’t speak for her, she—“

Delphine’s blade slices through his throat.

She turns to you.

“And you?”

Now! Grab her! Get dow—-

Finally you listen. You tackle Delphine just as the dimly lit green of the grass flares to white.

You only catch a glimpse of it before you clench your eyes shut: a wide white line glowing brighter than lightning, lancing across the sky.

It lasts nearly three seconds.

The sound comes after two. A bang like thunder, followed by the sound of rushing air.

With the sound comes the heat, trying to burn at your skin, even here, nearly half a mile away, if the delay’s an indication.

It must have hit the house.

And then it stops.

Delphine shoves you off her. She stands, but does not move.

You climb to your feet. Approach her. Grab her hand.

She doesn’t want to accept it. But you pull her along.
The police will be here soon. This is big enough to demand it. A terawatt laser, you assume. Set off in atmosphere!

They’d be here anyway, in a vain attempt to rescue the servants. Unlike the police on the other planets and moons, Dressaran police would just as soon let the well off die. A bit silly, as the “well off” were usually former servants themselves. Dressarans had odd customs and short lifespans.

If Delphine’s parents had left Dressara, it was likely to escape the deadly Dressaran game.

“Do you have a plan?” asks Delphine. You doubt she wants to have to think herself. Not at the moment. Not when she keeps glancing at the smoky haze in the again-dim dawn sky; towards the remains of the mansion; towards the melted wood; the fires; towards what isn’t there at all.

Yes. You have a plan.

“The police will be here soon,” you say.

Delphine looks disinclined to be around when they arrive. She is Dressaran elite, you suppose. You rest your remaining hand gently upon her shoulder as you listen.

“They’ll arrive over there,” you say, pointing towards a clearing. Delphine’s eyes were already on it. It had been where the woman in violet had stood the night before.

“They’ll all go towards the house and search for survivors,” you continue.

You pull her behind a tree as the police ship lands. You can hear its sirens.

You give them a minute, then pull Delphine from your cover.

“Shouldn’t need an Alt to pilot,” you whisper as you sneak towards the ship. “Police can’t always, well…”

Their Alts wouldn’t help them apprehend anyone. That would mean aiding in the countering of another’s bodily autonomy.

You board the ship. The police had, indeed, all left.

They’ll know as soon as you take off.

“What?”

You had paused. You were planning where to fly. How to escape.

Now you have to start over.

“Quiet,” you say. You furrow your brow. Maybe because you’re thinking. Perhaps because you want Delphine to know you’re thinking.

Fuck it. Simple is best. Even if idiotic.

You take off.
