# Chapter 4—Four
You turn sharply. If you can call out-of-atmosphere maneuvers “turns.”

As soon as the police ship is flying on course to just miss intercepting the hanger ship, you shut off everything, even the life support. It should be more than enough to last you the next twenty minutes.

They won’t have seen your maneuver from the other side of the moon. Their ships will ignore you as you aren’t actually on a course to approach nearer than a hundred meters.

But as you approach you don’t see any ships.

No big ones nearby to blast your ship as it exits the hanger. No crew transports indicating they’re waiting for you.

They could still be inside. They must be, if they’re tracking your ship.

You and Delphine cross the remaining distance in nothing but spacesuits, leaving the police ship to continue its orbit. They’ll find it before it derbies. Probably. Hard to say: with everything shut off they might not notice it until the moon’s last line of laser defense spots it and vaporizes it.

You enter the hanger through the airlock to find it empty but for your two ships—_your_ ship freshly repaired.

There must be someone here, Leanne.

It would be difficult for them to have boarded your ship, but the hanger might not notice if they refrained from damaging it.

Delphine, thankfully, knows to remain quiet.

You board. Delphine enters behind you, her back to yours.

There really aren’t many places to hide on your ship. Within a minute you’ve checked them all.

They could be on the other ship. It looks better. Nicer. They’d think you’d prefer it. And there’s hiding spots.

But for there to be no one on this ship?

“We’re going to Two,” you tell Delphine as you take off, the hanger’s main doors opening for you.

She says nothing for a moment. Finally, she finishes selecting her words. 

“Please join me in your bedroom once we are on course.”

----

“Where you on Four?” she asks, before you can take a seat. You notice her sword in her easy reach. You wonder how she fit it in the suit. But you suppose it’s not that much bigger than a knife.

It’s still bloody.

“Not to my knowledge,” you say.

Her eyes glance away. She’s thinking. Remembering.

“Like you don’t ‘think’ you have your original…”

She trails off. She knows some questions are private. She knows she’d kill you to learn what she’s after.

“Indeed,” you say. She stares at you. She’s waiting, Leanne.

“I could have been on Four,” you say. “I could have been there on the very day. I wouldn’t know.”

By now she’s figured it out, but perhaps you can’t see it on her face, as you spell it out. “I have no memory beyond three years ago. About two months after Four’s Exploit went awry.”

Delphine looks at you. You’re afraid she doesn’t believe you, but that’s because you’re awful at reading expressions when you’re not listening properly.

No. She’s simply… disappointed. Maybe even angry. Perhaps even thinking about the destruction of her home; of the people inside it; of how she’s no closer to knowing why than ever.

“I need to know,” she ays, finally.

“And I want to.”

“You should change course,” she says, suddenly.

You nod. “We’re not aimed at for Two’s orbit yet,” you say.

“Do we have enough power?”

You wave your hand towards the crate of energy cells.

“Really?” she asks. Most would be lucky to have one full cell to power their ship.

“The job was to destroy the shipment,” you say. You shrug. “I only took one crate. There were dozens. Still… not great at listening to instructions, I suppose.”

Seriously.

“I don’t know,” said Delphine. “Last night you didn’t seem to have trouble.”

You snort.

“We need to find food, anyway,” you say. You glance at what’s left of your supply. Enough for a day, maybe, with the two of you. You sigh. “Who should we steal from?”

Delphine blinks. To her, your statement must have seemed a non sequitur. You aren’t wanting for resources. Surely you could sell an energy cell, and buy some food?

“We can’t exactly buy stuff. There’s a bounty out on us both.”

“The one on me’s an assassination,” Delphine says. “I should know. I took it out.”

Don’t act so surprised, Leanne. She wasn’t surprised to see the hunter. She must have thought him an assassin. She _wanted_ them to find her. She had questions for them.

“Should be fine in public if I’m quick. They’re expecting me on Dressara,” she says.

You shake your head. “No. There’s a bounty out on you, too.”

Delphine barely misses a beat. Perhaps the bounty doesn’t surprise her.

“But the distribution centers—“

“Sure, they’ll give you food for a day or two. Maybe three. Might be worth it, actually… But me? I’m lucky if they give me a single meal,” you say. “And even then, they watch me eat it.”

“But even if you’re Altless… I mean, maybe one or two of them might be so—“

Try not to laugh, Leanne. She doesn’t know.

“I lived through that every day for nearly a month. Some centers were nicer than others. One on Delphinia wasn’t too bad. They gave me lunch and dinner to go, a couple of times.”

You rub the scars on your shoulder.

“I stopped trying after I got a bullet in my shoulder while waiting in line. I didn’t even know I could fight…

“So. Who do we steal from?”

----

The woman behind the counter peered at your hand. “Tampered with,” she said, shoving your hand back at you.

“By _you_. Last time it expired.”

“We do a better job than this.

----

“You can eat if you want, dear. Go ahead! We’re here any time you want.”

But only if you came in person. Braved the two hour line.

You wondered if you could learn to live on one meal a day.

----

You should have noticed them earlier. You only noticed after they turned towards you, guns raising.

Your leg lashed out before you fully realized the threat they posed.

One of them was on the ground, their gun in your hand, before the first bullet hit your shoulder.

There were screams.

You remember no more.

----

You woke up on your ship. Out of orbit. A few days of food.

Must have made it to a hospital. Only place that accepts _everyone._

You’re alive. Patched up.

You’re used to not remembering.
